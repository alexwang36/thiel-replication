I would like to introduce your host, Mr. Stuart Miller, CEO. Sir, you may begin.
Stuart Miller
Great. Thank you and thank you, David. This morning I am joined by Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer; Dave Collins, who you just heard from, Diane Bessette our Vice President and Treasurer, Rick Beckwitt our President; and Jeff Krasnoff, CEO of Rialto are all here with us, Jon Jaffe, our Chief Operating Officer is with us by phone from California and some of that group will be joining in our conversations during the Q&A period.
I am going to briefly give some remarks as I always do and Bruce is going to jump in and break down our financial detail and give some further guidance for next year as we always do at this time of year and then we'll open up to Q&A.As always, I'd like to request one question and one follow-up, so we can have as many participants as possible.
So let me go ahead and begin. Our fourth quarter and year-end results reflect our disciplined adherence to our company-wide strategies of managing our business to a clearly defined growth rate in order to run our business efficiently, while generating cash flow in order to fortify our balance sheet.
We grew our fourth quarter and full year 2016 earnings by 11% and 14% respectively, while we improved our balance sheet to a 33.4% homebuilding net debt to total cap ratio, which is now back to our pre-downturn financial condition. We view that as quite an accomplishment.
Across our platform in each of our business segments, we improved performance and operations to position for the future and to make the overall company stronger. As we arrive at the close of 2016, we are better able to achieve our overall goal of reverting to a pure-play homebuilder with an excellent operating platform and a healthy capital structure that enables us to be both opportunistic and to ultimately return capital to shareholders in the future.
All of this was accomplished in the context of market conditions that were suboptimal in 2016, defined by overall slow, but directionally steady market improvement that was often choppy and sometimes complicated.
As we look ahead to 2017, we expect to see a generally similar economic environment to find the homebuilding landscape with some potential upside from the new administration in Washington. Our company strategies of soft pivot on land, 7% to 10% growth target and improved cash flow will remain the same for now and we expect to achieve similar growth and balance sheet improvements in 2017 as Bruce will detail in our guidance for the next year.
These expectations derive from the following general views. Even with the now clear upward momentum movement in interest rates mapped out by the Fed and the many questions around taxes in the regulatory environment raised by our incoming potentially business friendly new President, we expect to see continued slow but steady market improvement that can be choppy and erratic at times as the new administration goes to the throes of enacting the agenda of change, upside exist to this view if a general sense of optimism continues to dominate and changes happen quicker, we'll have to wait and see.
We continue to believe though that production levels in the $1 million to $1.2 million starts per year range are still too low for the needs of American household growth that is now normalizing. The rather large production deficit that has continued to grow over the past years should continue to drive overall growth in the housing market. Therefore we see the current levels of production forming somewhat of a downside or floor to the market.
Even with interest rates moving higher, the first time homebuyer will continue to come back to the market as stronger economic conditions should drive purchasers to the market undeterred by the marginally higher monthly payment, especially in the context of continued rent increases.
Lower unemployment, wage growth and general consumer confidence should drive household formation, which drives families to purchase homes and to rent apartment. We believe that there continues to be strong pent-up demand for dwellings of all types across the country, though stronger in some markets than in others and this demand will continue to propel a continued long cycle, slow and steady market improvement that will not be derailed by slow movements in interest rates.
This goes for both the first time and the move up purchasers. While demand has been constrained by limited access to mortgages, we feel that any relaxing of the hyper regulated baking system will normalize the mortgage market, which should enable more purchasers to find their way to home ownership.
We continue to expect that demand will build and come to the market over the next years and that will drive increased production as the deficit in housing start ultimately needs to be replenished.
Nevertheless, availability of land and labor shortages continue to be limiting factors and constrain supply and restrict the ability to quickly respond to growing demand. We expect that these conditions will continue to result in a slow, steady though positive homebuilding market that will enable slow and steady growth throughout the industry.
These had been our consistent guiding views over the past year and we've mapped our operating strategy around these views through at this point we leave room for upside as we look ahead.
Each segment of our company has positioned itself for continued performance in 2017 and beyond and we believe -- and we remain well positioned to execute our operating plans and strategies in each of our business segments going forward.
Against this backdrop, let me briefly discuss each of our operating segments. Our for-sale core homebuilding operations have operated a very high level of efficiency with a steady growth pace and a focus on operational excellence throughout 2016.
As we've noted in past conference calls, we've adjusted our for-sale housing strategy as the recovery has matured and land pricing has gotten more expensive on the retail side. We've noted three key components of our core homebuilding strategy. Number one, soft pivot on land purchases; number two, lower targeting growth rate and number three, heavy focus on SG&A.
We've continued to reduce our combined land and land development spend and new orders in the fourth quarter and the full year grew at 9% while the year -- while deliveries for the year were also up 9%. This is right on top of our targeted growth rate and has enabled us to focus on reducing SG&A while driving cash flow.
We've reduced our SG&A throughout the year even while continued labor shortages, construction cost increases and land increases have tested our ability to match sales and delivery pace, our management team has managed sales prices, maximized margins and focused on SG&A in the fourth quarter to bring it to an 8.7% rate to offset pressure on gross margins and maintain a strong net margin, which came in at 14.6% for the quarter.
This was accomplished while we've also been increasing our spend on companywide technologies in order to realize additional reductions in the future. As we look ahead to 2017, we expect to continue to focus on these three pillars of our operating strategy in order to drive performance.
Our first of those pillars, we continue our soft pivot on land strategy as we are targeting high-quality A location -- A location land acquisition with a shorter two to three year average life. Additionally, we're focused on expanding our first time homebuyer offering organically with lower land cost as that segment of the market has continued to recover.
And finally, we've used the opportunistic, proposed purchase of WCI to fill in some blanks and partially offset land purchases, upgrading our land positions with already mature communities.
Second, we've noticed -- noted in past quarterly conference calls given the now mature recovery that we will continue to manage our growth in order to concurrently grow the bottom line and drive strong cash flows. We continue to manage the growth target -- our growth targets to achieve a growth rate in the 7% to 10% range as we've redirected our management efforts towards maximizing our net operating margin.
In the third prong with less pressure on top line growth rate, we've intensified management focus on driving faster bottom line growth and cash flow by maximizing pricing power and using innovative strategies to drive our SG&A down.
Under the company mantra, as I said last quarter of what we can measure, we can change, we are focused on changing and improving all elements of our operating platform. I noted the example in past quarters that we've been reducing customer acquisition costs through our digital marketing initiative.
We've expanded our focus to other operational elements of our business and are seeing reductions in expensive -- in expenses in those areas as well.
It is noteworthy that this quarter's SG&A of 8.7% is the lowest fourth quarter SG&A in our company's history and allow -- and that follows last quarter's lowest third quarter SG&A.
Our homebuilding operations are truly becoming extremely efficient operating machine with demand growing steadily, land limited, labor tight and constrained mortgage availability, we believe that our three-pronged strategy for homebuilding -- for our homebuilding segment, positions us well for steady growth as well as the ability to use a strong balance sheet to act opportunistically.
Moving on, our financial services group has also had an outstanding year of accomplishment in 2016. While the financial services operations have grown alongside our core homebuilding business, we've also benefited from a strong, though sometimes erratic refi market as well as from the expansion of retail opportunities in both our mortgage and title platforms.
While we expect refi opportunities to diminish as rates rise, the other sidecar opportunities have continued to expand our platform as we move through 2016 and that's reflected in our fourth quarter earnings of $51.4 million versus $33.8 last year.
Our strategy for 2017 for financial services continues to be to construct and maintain a fully self sufficient financial services platform that benefits from Lennar homebuilding business, but drives profitability from retail operations as well. Bruce oversees this operation and will discuss it further in his comments.
Next our multifamily program LMC Lennar Multifamily Communities, really matured in 2016 into a leading blue-chip developer of apartment communities across the country. LMC had an incredible quarter in our fourth quarter.
Earnings totaled $41.4 million up 306% from the $10.2 million in 2015. During the fourth quarter, we sold four of our merchant build apartment communities all with high IRRs and twp plus multiples. During the fourth quarter, we started 1,155 apartment homes in five communities with a total development cost of approximately $469 million.
As of November 30, 2016, we have -- we had a geographically diversified pipeline of 74 communities, totaling almost 23,000 apartment homes with a total development cost of approximately $7.7 billion.
Also during the fourth quarter, we had the final close of our now $2.2 billion Lennar Multifamily Venture, LMV -- we call LMV. LMV represents the largest equity capital raise ever completed in the multifamily industry and demonstrates the confidence venture investors have place in LMC and our new build-to-core strategy that will allow us to maintain an ownership interest in a portfolio of income producing communities going forward.
We continue to see growing demand in housing, both in our core homebuilding business as well as our multifamily platform and this venture is a key building block for one of our growing ancillary businesses.
Next our Rialto segment saw a nice turnaround in the back half of 2016 as the capital markets stabilized after a rough start in the first half of the year. During the quarter, market conditions continued to improve, particularly for RMF Rialto Mortgage Finance, which has maintained its position as one of the largest non-bank CMBS originators.
RMF completed its 32nd through 31st securitization transaction during the quarter selling over $622 million of RMF originated loans with very healthy net margins. This brings our total to over $6.5 billion of securitized loans since RMF's inception.
On the investment management front, we also previously announced first quarter closings of commitments for our third fund. This fund will complement our other opportunistic funds with readily available capital to invest.
Our first two flagship opportunity funds have continued to be top quartile producers. Fund one as an example became fully invested in early 2013 and we've now distributed the 141% of investor's original capital from income and monetization and with the distribution through this quarter, Rialto has now realized two times its original investment with a lot more to go.
Fund two made its final investment during the first quarter, investing including recycling over $1.6 billion of equity in 100 transactions and similar to fund one, we've been making distributions already returning about 36% of investor's original commitments.
Rialto's investment in asset management platform had been growing its asset base as well as harvesting value for investors and us. In a little over six years, we've now raised almost $7 billion of equity in a variety of real estate funds and investment vehicle we've invested about $6.1 billion of equity and we've already returned $4.8 billion to investors who have earned in excess -- who have earned almost $2.4 billion over the years.
Overall, our Rialto platform enables us to invest across all real estate and financial products and as we look ahead to 2017, Rialto earnings will continue to grow as we work through our remaining legacy assets and refine our businesses into a two-pronged capital-light segment focused solely on RMF Rialto Mortgage Finance and the investment management business as well.
Finally FivePoint is now a self-sufficient standalone company that’s a premier strategic large scale community builder in California. In 2016, we successfully contributed and exchanged our interest in three strategic joint ventures and our interest in the management company for an investment in this newly formed entity called FivePoint Holdings LLC.
This transaction liberated FivePoint in 2016 to start acting independently to raise capital and to use its pristine balance sheet to operate opportunistically. It also positioned FivePoint to take advantage of either a recovered IPO market should that happen for other opportunities as they arise. We simply could not be more excited about the long-term prospects for this one of a kind leader in community development.
So overall and in conclusion let me say 2016 was a great strategic year for the company and it sets up another year of consistent performance and opportunity. We feel very confident that our view of the market and the strategies that we've successfully implemented in our business have worked very well to position us for continued performance and future growth in 2017 and beyond.
So now let me turn over to Bruce.
Bruce Gross
Thanks Stuart and good morning. I'll provide some additional color on our 11% earnings increase over the prior year.
Revenues from home sales increased 11% in the fourth quarter, driven by an 8% increase in wholly-owned deliveries and a 3% year-over-year increase in average selling price to $357,000.
Our gross margin on home sales in the fourth quarter was 23.3%, which was in line with our stated goals. The prior year's gross margin percentage was 24.6%. The gross margin decline year-over-year was due primarily to increased land costs and construction costs.
Sales incentives were 6.2% this quarter compared to 5.9% in the prior year. The slight increase was primarily due to our focus on reducing completed unsold homes, which we managed to decreased by 13% year-over-year to 975 homes.
Gross margin percentages were once again highest in the East region and our direct construction cost increases have moderated compared to the prior year. These costs were up 3% year-over-year to approximately $54 per square foot and this was driven entirely by the labor side, which was offset just slightly by a small decrease in material costs.
Our SG&A percentage improved 50 basis points as Stuart mentioned to 8.7% in the fourth quarter. About 30 basis points of that improvement was attributable to operating leverage from growing volume organically in our existing homebuilding divisions and the other 20 basis points was due to improvement and advertising costs, which we reduced as a result of our focus on digital marketing.
Gross profits on land sales during the quarter were $24.3 million was primarily driven by 3 million transactions during the quarter versus 7.9 million in the prior year.
Equity and loss from unconsolidated entities was $24.6 million, which included our share of net operating losses from the newly created FivePoint entity. We opened 66 new communities during the fourth quarter to end the quarter with 695 active communities.
New home orders -- new home orders increased 9% and the new order dollar value increased 12% for the quarter. Our sales pace was higher during the quarter to 3.2 sales per community, per month, versus 3.0 in the prior year and the cancellation rate was 18%.
During the quarter, we purchased approximately 4,500 home sites, totaling $259 and this is the same dollar amount that we purchased in the prior year's quarter. These numbers align with what Stuart highlighted about our soft pivot strategy, where we're focused on buying shorter duration land while continuing to grow the company.
The number of years of land owned has now been reduced to 4.8 years. Our home sites owned and controlled now total 159,000 home sites of which 33,000 are controlled. Our financial services business segment had strong results with operating earnings of $51.4 million compared to $33.8 million in the prior year.
Mortgage pretax income increased to $36.6 million from $25.9 million in the prior year. The improved earnings were driven by an increased profit per loan due to the favorable interest rate environment and higher volumes. Mortgage originations increased to $2.7 million compared to $2.4 billion in the prior-year and we captured 81% of Lennar homebuyers.
As a result of a focused effort to capitalize on the low mortgage rates in the fourth quarter, we achieved a 72% increase in refinance origination volume versus the prior year. Refinance volume was 15% of the total origination volume, but the strong refinance market also drove higher margins per loan.
Our title company's profit increased to $14.9 million in the quarter from $8 million in the prior year and this was primarily due to higher refinance transaction volume and the focus on operational efficiencies.
Providing a little bit more color on Rialto segment, the produced operating earnings of $8 million compared to $7.6 million in the prior year. Both amounts are net of non-controlling interests. The investment management business contributed $33.1 million of earnings, which included $4.6 million of equity and earnings from the real estate funds and $28.5 million of management fees and other.
At quarter end, the undistributed hypothetical carried interest for Rialto real estate funds one and two, now totals $141 million. Rialto Mortgage Finance contributed $622 million of commercial loans into four securitization resulting in earnings of $35.6 million compared with $854 million and $15.8 million in the prior year respectively, before their G&A expenses.
The increase in earnings was primarily due to an increase in average net margins of the securitizations from 2.2% in the prior year to 5.8% in the fourth quarter. The direct investments in Rialto had a loss of $10.7 million in the quarter and Rialto's G&A and other expenses were $43.3 million for the quarter and interest expense excluding the warehouse lines was $6.7 million. Rialto also ended the quarter with a strong liquidity position with $149 million of cash.
Adding to Stuart's comments on multifamily, the $41.4 million operating profit in the quarter was driven primarily by the segment's $47.2 million share gains from the sale of four operating properties as well as management fee income, partially offset by G&A expenses.
We ended the quarter with five completed and operating properties and 38 under construction, 13 of which are in lease up, totaling over 11,000 apartments with a total development cost of approximately $3.4 billion, so you could see the pipelines for the sales that we're going to talk about for 2017.
Our tax rate for the quarter was 32.5%. The rate is lower than our previous guidance, primarily as a result of the tax department's continuing efforts to maximize new home energy efficiency credit, which is currently set to expire at the end of 2016. As a result of the expiration of this credit, we expect the tax rate for 2017 to be approximately 34%.
Turning to the balance sheet, the matching of the operating strategies with our execution has returned our balance sheet to the very healthy levels that existed before the downturn. We highlighted that the soft pivot strategy, strong profitability and the conversion of our converts will drive the path to lower leverage.
The result was an 880 basis point decline in net debt to total cap, going from 42.2% at the end of the prior year to 33.4% at this year end. This year we generated between $400 million and $500 million of operating cash flow in 2016. Our liquidity strength provides exceptional financial flexibility with now over $1 billion of cash and no borrowings on our $1.8 billion revolving credit facility.
Our balance sheet is rock solid and its positioning us well for tomorrow's opportunities. Additionally, stockholders equity now exceeds $7 billion and our book value per share increased to $29.96 per share.
During the quarter, we converted the remaining $157 million of our 3.25% convertible senior notes. Next step for the balance sheet will be continued focus on cash flow generation and retiring the $400 million of 12.25% debt on June 1, which currently cost us approximately $50 million of interest per year.
Now I would like to provide some goals for 2017. Please note these goals exclude the benefit from the WCI acquisition, which we will update in our first quarter conference call assuming the transaction closes as expected in our first quarter.
We still expect the transaction to be accretive to our fiscal 2017 numbers, excluding transaction costs. Number one deliveries, we are currently geared up to deliver between 28,500 and 29,000 deliveries for 2017. We expect the backlog conversion ratio to be approximately 70% for the first quarter, between 80% and 85% for the second and third quarters and over 90% for the fourth quarter.
We are expecting an average sales price between 365,000 and 370,000 for the full year. We expect operating margins to be around 13% for the full year. The full year gross margin is expected to be in the range of 22% to 22.5%. We expect continuing improvement in the SG&A line from operating leverage and our investments in technology, reducing SG&A to somewhere between 9.1% and 9.3% for the full year.
There will be seasonality between the quarters with the first quarter being the lowest operating margin and the operating leverage is expected primarily in the second half of the year to match up with our highest volume quarters.
Financial services are expected to be in the range of $155 million to $160 million for the year. The quarterly amounts are expected to be spread fairly similar to 2016 with the first quarter anticipated to be the lowest quarter of profitability.
With rising interest rates, we expect the strong refinance market that we did see in 2016 to start to slow down as we go through 2017. Rialto is expected to generate a range of profits between $45 million and $55 million for the year and the second half of the year is expected to have the bulk of the profitability for this segment.
Multifamily expects to sell seven to eight multifamily communities in 2017 with a range of profits between $70 million and $80 million for the full year. We expect to be profitable each quarter with the fourth quarter profits similar to 2016's very strong fourth quarter.
The category of joint ventures, land sales and other income group together, we're expecting to have a range of $70 million to $80 million of profitability for this category and although we don't anticipate profitability in the first two quarters of the year out of this grouping, we do expect strong profitability in the second half of the year.
Corporate G&A is expected to be between 2.2% and 2.3% of total company revenues as we continue to invest and repiping our systems and technology initiatives. As I mentioned our tax rate for 2017 should be approximately 34% and our net community count is expected to increase approximately 7% from our account of 695 with the increased spread throughout the year primarily in the second, third, and fourth quarters.
And then finally we continue to focus on cash flow generation and expect to generate a similar level of operating cash flow in 2017 as we get into 2016. With these goals in mind we are well-positioned to deliver another strong profitable year in 2017.
With that let me turn it back to the operator and open it up for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Ivy Zelman of Zelman & Associates. Your line is now open.
Ivy Zelman
Thank you. Congratulations guys on another solid quarter. Stuart, if you can talk a little bit about the usage of free cash flow that's very impressive in '17 and how to increase shareholder value with that free cash flow where they get deployed and thinking about the uncertainties, but as you've mentioned in your opening remarks, the positive potential business environment that we may or pro-business administration may be taking, thinking about the opportunities that you think will the pluses or minuses of the new administration at least what you've heard so far.
I think people are pretty interested if you go into little bit more specific obviously tax reforms, some of the things that might drive how you invest that free cash flow to drive shareholder value?
Stuart Miller
Okay. So that was a multipart question, Ivy. I'm going to give you credit for the two point questions and your follow up on that. So to start off with you asked about free cash flow and how we might think to deploy that to enhance shareholder value and let me say hats off to Rick as he aptly negotiated our proposed deal with WCI.
He injected great deal of optionality
