Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Boston Scientific Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I will now like to turn the conference over to your host, Susan Lisa. Please go ahead.
Susan Lisa
Thank you, Greg. Good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us. With me on today’s call are Mike Mahoney, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q2 2020 results, which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release, as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today’s call to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading “Financials & Filings”.
The duration of this morning’s call will be approximately one hour. Mike will focus his comments on Q2 performance inclusive of the impact of COVID-19 pandemic as well as catalyst for recovery by business. Dan will review the financials for the quarter and then we’ll take your questions. During today’s Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officers, Dr. Ian Meredith and Dr. Ken Stein.
Before we begin, I’d like to remind everyone that on the call, operational revenue excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, and organic revenue further excludes the impact of certain acquisitions, including Vertiflex and BTG in the relevant periods for which there are no prior period-related net sales, as well as the divestiture of the global embolic microspheres portfolio and intrauterine health franchise. On this call, all references to sales and revenue unless otherwise specified are organic.
Finally, average daily sales or ADS normalizes sales growth for difference in selling days year-over-year. Also of note, this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, believe, estimate and other similar words. They include, among other things, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic upon the company's operations and financial results; statements about our growth and market share; new product approvals and launches; clinical trials; cost savings and growth opportunities; our cash flow and expected use; our financial performance, including sales, margins and earnings; as well as our tax rates, R&D spend, and other expenses. July trends provided qualitatively refer to month-to-date results and actual results may differ materially from those discussed in these and any forward-looking statements.
Factors that may cause such differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today’s date and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them.
At this point, I’ll turn it over to Mike for his comments.
Michael Mahoney
Thank you, Susie. Good morning and thank you to everyone for joining us today. I also want to express my gratitude to all of our employees at Boston Scientific who are helping serve our customers, patients and communities during the COVID-19 pandemic and living our winning spirit value every day.
As the impact of the Coronavirus began to spread globally in the first quarter, we took a number of cost related actions as outlined at our first quarter earnings call, in the face of significant uncertainty to protect our employees and also to ensure the strength of Boston Scientific.
Importantly, with a consistent monthly improvement in sales trends, we have accordingly ended our reduced employee work schedule. We’re accelerating key investments appropriately, appropriately increasing variable spending CapEx, and we’re quickly ramping up manufacturing production to pre-COVID levels throughout most of our plant network.
We’re also establishing new and stronger capabilities and virtual physician education, remote clinical support, and digital sales enablement to partner with our customers on this path to recovery. We absolutely appreciate the agility of our global team and we absolutely believe that we will emerge from the pandemic a stronger company.
I’ll now provide detailed highlights on performance in second quarter 2020, including average daily sales trends for the month of June. I won’t give specific July results, but it’s encouraging to see that across all of our businesses, July trends are continuing to improve nicely from June levels.
For the second quarter of 2020, total company sales declined 23% on an operational basis. On a regional basis, Asia-Pac declined 14 in second quarter, but importantly delivered growth of plus 2% in China for the quarter. In addition for the month of June, China, Australia and New Zealand and Korea all delivered year-over-year growth. Europe, Middle East, Africa declined 26% in the second quarter, yet importantly, six countries returned to growth versus prior year in the month of June.
Finally, while revenue in the U.S. dropped the most in April down 55%, the U.S. has also seen the sharpest recovery declining 12% in June on an ADS basis, and 28% in second quarter, both versus the prior period.
Total company sales declined 29% on an organic basis as trends evolve throughout the quarter that were in line with the previous outlook we provided in our first quarter call. April sales declines was the trough with monthly sequential improvement in May and again in June.
Specifically, worldwide organic revenue was down 47% in April, down 24% in May and down 17% in June, on an average daily sales basis. Operationally, interventional medicine contributed 320 basis points to sales versus prior year and Vertiflex contributed 20 basis points before those sales went organic in June.
In addition, spec pharma sales of $68 million in the quarter was ahead of forecast and contributed 260 basis points to total company sales. Adjusted operating income of approximately 250 million represents a 12.6% adjusted operating margin, roughly half the rate of 25.5 in the second quarter 2019.
Adjusted EPS for the second quarter was $0.08, which is a 70% decline versus second quarter 2019. Much of the shortfall occurred at the gross margin level, given lower volumes, which Dan will detail further.
Now to turn to the outlook for the rest of the year. While July has seen flare ups of COVID related challenges in certain regions, we’re very encouraged by the strengthening trends we’ve seen in July versus those in June.
From a regional perspective, we see various sales results based on the different phases of recovery with Asia-Pac having recovered the most followed by the U.S. and then Europe. All told there is no change to the 2020 outlook we gave in our late Q1 earnings call. We estimate that Q3 revenue will likely decline year-over-year, [both] [ph] improved sequentially versus second quarter, and there we aim to return to organic growth in fourth quarter.
Despite the procedure volume impact from COVID-19, our businesses remain strong, with a compelling global pipeline and several on-going launches and recent approvals that are helping lead our recovery, as well as the overall favorable mix of our business in terms of high acuity mix, and outpatient side of care.
Recall that a binary split of elective emergent does not clearly reflect clinical practice that we have seen and expect to continue to see a higher rate of recapture of deferred procedures, given the majority of the conditions we treat have a relatively high level of acuity, and thus generally can’t be deferred for extended periods.
I’ll now provide some additional commentary in our business units. Starting with urology and Pelvic Health, sales declined 32% organically in the quarter with June ADS down 12% versus prior year and July trends are continuing to improve versus June. Our Stone and Prostate health franchises led to recovery, and thus far we have seen a faster than expected recovery at our prosthetic urology and pelvic floor franchise. We continue to believe uro/PH will have one of the faster potential recovery curves.
In addition, we recently received positive guidance from the United Kingdom National Institute of Health and Care Excellence, called NICE for Rez
