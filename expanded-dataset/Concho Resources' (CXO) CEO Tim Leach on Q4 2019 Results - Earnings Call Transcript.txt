Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Concho's fourth quarter 2019 earnings call. Our earnings release and corporate presentation are available on our website, and we plan to file our annual report on Form 10-K today after market close. Participants on today's call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations. They are subject to risks and uncertainties, forward-looking statement and other disclaimers are provided in the earnings release and presentation.
Our comments today may also reference non-GAAP financial measures. You'll find the appropriate reconciliations in our earnings materials. I'm joined today in Midland by Tim Leach, our Chairman and CEO; along with President, Jack Harper; Chief Operating Officer, Will Giraud, and members of the Concho senior management team. Following our prepared remarks, we will host a question-and-answer session. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.
Now let me turn the call over to Tim.
Tim Leach
Thanks, Megan. Good morning. I'm very pleased with the fourth quarter, and the reasons to be a concho shareholder continue to be compelling. We're growing margins, growing free cash flow, growing distributions to shareholders and doing this while advancing sustainability. We've assembled a top tier Permian asset base in our own backyard with multiple decades of project inventory that strengthens our ability to generate free cash flow and increase returns to shareholders.
In this dynamic environment, we'll continue to focus on disciplined reinvestment, controlling costs and maintaining a strong financial position. Since our third quarter of 2019 earnings call, we've seen oil prices rollercoaster between $50 and $60, and we've been both places twice. Despite the commodity price volatility and many uncertainties, our business model is designed to deliver free cash flow across a wide range of commodity prices.
Last year, we identified six key areas for improvement, which included reducing well cost. Our well cost continue to move in the right direction as a result of safely drilling and completing wells faster. We're also transitioning to next-generation frac equipment that is more efficient and provides cost savings and emission reductions.
Second, lowering our cost structure. For the fourth quarter of 2019, controllable costs were 17% lower year-over-year, and we're well below our target of $9 per BOE. Third, selling noncore assets. We closed the New Mexico Shelf asset sale on November 1, bringing full year 2019 sales proceeds to $1.3 billion. Fourth, delivering profitable growth. Fourth quarter oil volumes increased 4% quarter-over-quarter in spite of the production impact resulting from the New Mexico Shelf asset sale.
Fifth, reducing debt, with the proceeds from the shelf sale, we ended the year with no bank debt and $70 million of cash on the balance sheet. And finally, increasing returns to shareholders. In 2019, we paid $100 million of dividends and repurchased $250 million of stock.
Going forward, we recognize that both asset quality and execution are necessary to the success of our business. We made real progress toward our goals in the second half of the year, and I'm proud of our employees for their performance. Their efforts are directly benefiting our bottom line and driving the inflection in free cash flow that we delivered in the fourth quarter.
Now turning to 2020. Jack will speak to the specific numbers, but I want to summarize our high-level strategy for the year. We're focused on four things. First, growing margins. We have several ways within our control to grow margins, including cost reductions and a better capital program. We also stand to benefit from better oil price realizations, as Permian barrels are now pricing at a premium.
Second, growing free cash flow. We expect lower well cost and our focus on smaller projects and wider spacing will result in better well productivity, which supports growing free cash flow. And we have the inventory and operational capability to support our commitment to free cash flow over the long-term. Third, growing distributions. Yesterday, we announced a 60% increase to our dividend. The dividend raise demonstrates our confidence in the cash flow potential of our business.
Also in the fourth quarter of 2019, we initiated a $1.5 billion share repurchase program. We were active in the fourth quarter and bought back 3.3 million shares at an average price of $76 per share. Fourth, advancing sustainability. Our stakeholders are seeking greater transparency regarding sustainability and we take this seriously. Our flared volumes averaged 1.6% of gross in 2019 compared to 2.7% in 2018. We've published a two-degree scenario report, and we're working on the sustainability report to detail our progress.
This set of priorities and the results of our drilling in 2019 guided our capital allocation and development strategy for 2020 and beyond. We're developing the assets with wider spacing and have multiple decades of inventory. Additionally, we're looking to optimize our acreage position through trades with adjacent operators. Our portfolio management efforts in 2019, increased the average lateral length of our inventory by 7% and our working interest by 2%.
Our inventory is a key advantage that enables us to deliver attractive long-term returns. We've talked about the evolution of the E&P business model from pure growth to restrain growth, greater free cash flow and higher returns. We've built momentum over the last two quarters, delivering on strategic focus that we laid out last year and providing a plan for 2020 that we believe makes a compelling investment case for the future.
With that, I'll turn it over to Jack.
Jack Harper
Thanks, Tim, and good morning. I am proud of the results and increase in cash flow the team delivered in the fourth quarter. We continue to prioritize financial discipline and cost management, and our performance over the past two quarters enhances our competitiveness, improves our platform for continued growth and strengthens the investment case for Concho.
Reviewing the fourth quarter specifically, oil volumes totaled 215,000 barrels per day, which exceeded the high end of our guidance range. It also represented an 8% increase from the same period last year. On the cost side, we made significant progress as well. Controllable costs, which includes lease operating, cash G&A and interest expense totaled $8.43 per unit, achieving our $9 target ahead of schedule. Also, during the final quarter of the year, we reinforced our investment-grade balance sheet by eliminating our revolver balance.
Now to the key metric, free cash flow. We generated $187 million in free cash flow for the quarter, which reflects the difference between operating cash flow before changes in working capital of $801 million and exploration and development cost incurred of $614 million. There are two important drivers for the cash flow growth. Our high cash margin production and improving efficiencies across our drilling and completion operations.
For 2019, average drilling, completion and equipment costs per foot were just below $1,000, which reflects an 18% decrease compared to 2018. Despite all the movement during 2019, we stayed within our guided capital budget and grew oil production 25% year-over-year. We also moved to a steadier drilling program in the second half of 2019, which carries into 2020 and will lead to a more efficient capital program.
For 2020, we are planning a $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion capital budget with our activity equally split between the Delaware and Midland basins. We expect this level of investment will result in drilling, completing and turning online approximately 300 wells during the year. The average project size will be six wells, and our average well spacing will be 700 to 800 feet as compared to approximately 550 feet last year.
Rolling our cost improvements in faster cycle times together, we expect to spend approximately 10% less year-over-year, while completing about 10% more lateral feet. Our activity is expected to generate 10% to 12% oil production growth, which represents 217,000 to 221,000 barrels of oil per day compared to pro forma 2019 volumes of 197,000 barrels per day.
Gas and NGL prices have fallen since our third quarter 2019 call, but our hedge book has this in a position to deliver on the priorities and targets that we've previously discussed. We expect to fund the capital program and generate $350 million of free cash flow at $50 oil and current prices for gas and NGLs due to lower well cost, a lower cost structure and beneficial hedges that provide stability in a volatile market.
After our third quarter call, we layered on hedges at $57 WTI. So while they limit our upside and a $60 scenario, they are substantially above market in today's $50 environment. Our forecast for $650 million of free cash flow at $60 oil, includes the new hedges as well as current NGL prices. We see the potential to deliver $750 million in free cash flow with strong execution and an NGL environment consistent with $60 crude.
So again, 2020 is off to a great start, and we will continue to focus on growing margins, growing free cash flow, growing distributions and advancing sustainability. These priorities will support our performance. We also have a very strong commitment to capital discipline because we believe it's key to maintaining a strong balance sheet and growing long-term value through the cycles.
We'll now turn the call back over to the moderator for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan.
Arun Jayaram
Yes. Good morning. My first question is related to the improvement in cash margins that we saw in 4Q. In 4Q, your controllable cash costs LOE, G&A and interest were $8.43 per BOE, and that did include some of the impact from your higher cost, New Mexico Shelf assets. The 2020 guide, using the midpoints, looks like it's $9.17 per barrel. If you use the low end of the guidance range, it's around 9%. So just wondered if you could help us reconcile the 4Q run rate in the cost structure versus the 2020 guide?
Jack Harper
Yes, Arun, this is Jack. The fourth quarter had a couple of things in there. First off, strong production. We also had a couple of onetime items that will not be recurring. But as we look forward to 2020, our midpoint of our guide, as you say, is just above $9, I hope with strong performance and execution throughout the year, we can make our way towards that bottom end.
Arun Jayaram
Great. And just on the oil differentials, we're also tighter than your guidance, which obviously drove the cash margin uptick in the fourth quarter. What's your thoughts on diffs into 2020?
Jack Harper
Yes. Well, going back a little bit in time, we're glad that we were patient thing that Midland pricing was coming to us, and that has happened. And so that has been very beneficial to price a barrel in Midland, and we see it like that out for the next couple of years.
Arun Jayaram
Great. And just my follow-up, Jack. What stood out to us as the fact that you're completing 20 more wells than you're placing under production this year. What is driving that delta? And could this have some positive implications for 2021 as well?
Jack Harper
Sure. The way I would really characterize the entire 2020 program is steady. We're going to run about the same number of rigs and completion crews throughout the year. So it really should be roughly equal during the year, wells drilled and then – and put on.
Arun Jayaram
Okay. Fair enough. Thanks a lot.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question will come from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.
Brian Singer
Thank you. Good morning.
Jack Harper
Good morning.
Brian Singer
Given some of the movement in terms of how the reserves that have been added and the cost of reserves and F&D cost to add reserves. With a better program focused on wider spacing in 2020, what would be your expectations for what the 2020 capital program would deliver from a reserve replacement perspective based on kind of what your expectations are for F&D costs on the wider space program?
Jack Harper
Yes. Good morning, Brian, it’s Jack. I would expect the go-forward 2020 and beyond F&D and reserve replacement to look a lot more like the past. We had some well-documented issues in 2019 with some spacing tests. But going forward, with the space program and the efficiency we're seeing in our drilling program, I feel that we will look more like the past.
Brian Singer
Great, thanks. And then on Slide 8, you talk about your expectations for lateral length moving up to about 10,000 feet in 2020 versus 9,000 feet. Can you add a bit more color on how you see the Midland Basin varying from the Delaware Basin? And then can you also talk to where you see, if at all, any maximum lateral lengths or at least any limitations on lateral lengths from a technology perspective or just a risking perspective?
Will Giraud
Brian, it's Will. Yes, pushing that average lateral length up to 10,000 feet is really a result of the team's doing a good job trading around and blocking up our acreage position. So I think that's a positive driver into 2020. As to – between the different basins, the way you get to that 10,000 on average is a blend of a little bit higher than that on the Midland Basin, then a little bit less than that on the Delaware Basin. But broadly in both places, we are getting the 2 miles as our base lateral length in the Midland Basin. We pushed to 2.5 and then even some examples recently 3. But from an acreage position, 2 miles is really a good number to use.
Brian Singer
And do you think that there is – or do you see an opportunity to add more acreage for the purposes of increasing the lateral length beyond the 2 miles? Or is that something that will be part of how you would think about use of capital to further improve efficiencies?
Will Giraud
I mean, I think there's opportunity to do that. When you ask about use of capital, I think the best way to do that is with noncore assets as currency in these trades. So that's really what we're using to lengthen laterals and kind of continue to block up our position.
Brian Singer
Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from Derrick Whitfield with Stifel.
Derrick Whitfield
Good morning, all. Congrats on a strong year-end update.
Jack Harper
Thank you.
Will Giraud
Thanks.
Derrick Whitfield
Beginning with your capital efficiency chart on Page 8, the year-over-year sequential improvement is quite impressive. Could you comment on what degree of improved well productivity year-over-year is implied in your forecast?
Jack Harper
Hey, Derrick, it's Jack. Good morning. Yes, we – with the up space program and our – the well cost coming down, 2020 does imply a more efficient program, no doubt, but it's driven both by the cost and the expected performance.
Derrick Whitfield
Okay. Thanks. And as my follow-up, I'd like to focus on sustainability and would certainly want to commend you and your team on the sustainability initiatives and your positive recognition in yesterday's Texas Railroad Commission on flaring study. Perhaps for Tim or Will or Jack, could you guys elaborate on your efforts to expand water recycling firm-wide, as you referenced on Page 12 of the deck?
Will Giraud
Sure. Hey, Derrick, it's Will. Yes, water recycling is a big push right now. And for ourselves and for industry to get to higher and higher percentages of water recycling, it's going to require big trunk line, shared third-party infrastructure. So that's been one of the drivers behind some of these transactions you've seen us do on the water side, so that we can source more recycled water and also recycle an increasing percentage of our own.
Derrick Whitfield
Very helpful, guys. Thanks for your time.
Will Giraud
Thank you, Derrick.
Jack Harper
Thank you, Derrick.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Paul, your line is open. Please go ahead. Okay. We’ll take our next question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.
Doug Leggate
Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Guys, I wonder if I could just had one housekeeping question and one detailed question on inventory. My housekeeping question is that the GP&T guidance is obviously up a little bit. My guess is that's related to Gulf Coast sales. Can you just walk us through how you expect that to trend? What your current Gulf Coast exposure looks like and whether you would consider changing the absolute volumes committed at the cost at some point?
Will Giraud
Sure. Hi, Doug. this is Will. Yes, the driver there, we’ve talked about that waterborne pricing deal we did on about 50,000 barrels of oil gross a day, and so that’s what’s pushing GP&T up. There’s also an offsetting increase in the price we realized for that. And as Jack mentioned earlier, just in terms of thinking about how that may change over time. We did that transaction to get access to waterborne pricing to kind of build that portfolio of pricing points. But as we sit here today, we like the blend we have of kind of Midland-based pricing for a majority of it and some exposure to water point pricing for the rest.
Doug Leggate
So, the 50,000 is a good number going forward for what duration, Will?
Will Giraud
It’s kind of a five-or-so year deal.
Doug Leggate
Okay. Like I said, this was just really more about the realization that goes on the other side, and that’s where I was trying to get to. So, thank you for that. My follow-up is really is, you defined in your deck as you’ve done many, many times that you’ve got decades of inventory. I think you guys have done a pretty good job, as you’ve probably seen in our work at least of emphasizing free cash flow, which we think is about the only reasonable way to value any E&P nowadays. The other set of that, however, is what the sustaining capital as it goes along with its free cash flow and inventory numbers.
So, I’m wondering if you can walk us through where that stands today, your maintenance capital, if you like, and how you think it evolves as your portfolio. I assume there’s 10%-plus growth rate as the new normal. How does that sustaining capital evolve? And I’ll leave it there.
Jack Harper
Yes, Doug. The way we see it today, our sustaining capital is about $2 billion. That over a longer period of time, we think the base decline rate will moderate somewhat. So, my expectation is that number would – could improve over time and yield more free cash flow.
Doug Leggate
Okay. I guess, if I may just offer an observation, I think, in order to compare an E&P with the broader market, some visibility on those numbers is what we would thought would be more consistent disclosure. So, do you guys could give out some thought, it would be much appreciated?
Jack Harper
Okay. One other thing I would add is, the focus in 2020 and then the $50 environment is more tilted towards rate of return as we’ve spoken about. You asked about our inventory, and so that does have implications on the inventory. But the good news is, I think we see strong opportunities for as far out as we can see that will allow for the way I described our capital over – in the future.
Doug Leggate
I appreciate the answer, guys. Thanks, again.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust.
Neal Dingmann
Good morning, guys. My first question is on growth and yields. I’m just wondering, you definitely now have very compelling oil-drilled free cash flow yield and dividend yield. I’m just wondering, how much do you think about Tim prioritizing these if you had to going forward?
Tim Leach
Yes. We spend a lot of time talking about that. We’ve talked about that on this call from the past that we want the dividend to be a meaningful part of the investment consideration. We took a big step in this quarter to get there. And that’s our first priority and call on cash flow. And so as I think about returning capital to shareholders, I think a growing dividend is the highest priority way. And – but we’ve also demonstrated that at different pricing levels, we’ll generate different amounts of free cash flow that will be available to also return to shareholders. And that way, we would do primarily through share repurchases at the right time.
Neal Dingmann
No, that certainly makes that certainly makes sense. I like the combination. And then my second question is on the flexibility for 2020 program. I’m just wondering how actively will you move around those 18-or-so rigs that you have throughout your Northern and Southern Midland and Delaware positions this year? Or is it kind of set of where they might operate?
Will Giraud
Neal, it’s Will. I think the way Jack characterized the program steady is a good way to think about the activity level of those rigs as they move around different parts of the basin.
Neal Dingmann
Will, does that include – if I could, just one follow-up. Does that include – you certainly have seemed to have one of the more stable or steadier programs, I think, almost the same rigs since late August now. Is that even in this environment, you’re pretty comfortable with running around that same type of program throughout this year?
Will Giraud
For sure. I mean, I think that was a big part of our 2020 budget was to budget around a conservative oil price and plan to run that activity, not foolishly if we see something dramatically lower. But one of the big lessons from last year is the benefits of running a steady, consistent program.
Neal Dingmann
Very noticeable. Thanks, guys.
Will Giraud
Thank you.
Tim Leach
Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question will come from John Freeman with Raymond James.
John Freeman
Good morning, guys.
Will Giraud
Good morning, John.
John Freeman
Just looking again, at the really big improvement on the cycle times, especially from 3Q 2019 to 4Q 2019, with another 10% improvement, is there any way to drill down a little bit more into that, just in terms of what drove that big of an increase? I mean, any few things that you could point to?
Jack Harper
Sure. It’s – that steadiness. It’s staying in the same areas and really focusing on doing the same well types over and over again. We also did, I think, improve our overall well design over the course of the back half of 2019, and then just – we’ve had really good run times and overall efficiencies with our different partners.
John Freeman
And then last quarter, you broke out sort of what was driving some of the savings in the Northern Delaware, and it pointed out that water was about 30% of the savings in the Delaware. What’s sort of the just big high-level ballpark sort of estimates on the Midland side, in terms of you’re breaking out similar to how you did the Northern Delaware last quarter?
Jack Harper
Yes. It probably doesn’t look that different, like we talked about earlier, increasing the amount of recycled water we use. There’s a savings element in that. Clearly, the – to the extent, sand costs have improved, that applies to both sides of the basin. And then the Midland is probably where we’ve been able to continue to push lateral lengths past that two-mile piece, which helps you meaningfully on a dollar per foot basis.
John Freeman
Great. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.
Will Giraud
Thanks, John.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question will come from Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets.
Scott Hanold
Thanks. Good morning. If I wouldn’t – could drive into the resources that you all have. I mean, in past, you guys have talked about your resource base a little bit. I think the prior one last year was 26,000 locations at about 12 billion BOE. When you look at your new spacing configuration and how you view as premium inventory – I know you talked about having plenty of length in that. But do you have some numbers you can help kind of quantify for us with that?
Jack Harper
Yes. Scott, the way I would characterize that is just to say that we have prioritized rate of return in the back half of 2019 and going forward in 2020. And we have as many years of that as we can see looking forward in a very similar disbursement of rates of return in our assets. So while it’s still measured in decades. If rate of return remains the focus in this commodity price, it will not be as many as the highest it once was, but it will be measured in decades.
Will Giraud
I think it’s good to remind you that, in previous conversations, we talked about the balance of rate of return and recoveries. And as Jack said that in this environment, in 2020, we’re – we’ve got a spacing program that’s focused on rate of return, and we have ample inventory around that spacing design, but it’s flexible. And those two things are related: the resource base and the economics based on the spacing design.
Scott Hanold
So, when you step back and look at it, I mean – and you talked about decades of inventory, and certainly, I think you’ve got that good visibility with your footprint on a map, but do you sense that the inventory is adequate? Or do you think it’s maybe a little bit too much where you’d still look at some select larger monetizations, stuff you may not get to for a while? Or is it just more blocking and tackling today?
Jack Harper
Yes. Scott, we certainly have – we’re happy with the amount of inventory we have. If you look at what we’ve done over the last two or three years in terms of monetizing assets, both midstream and upstream, I hope that’s an indication of our willingness to sell things that are at the back end of our priority from a capital allocation standpoint, and we will continue looking at our portfolio through that same lens.
Scott Hanold
Understood. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question will come from Leo Mariani with KeyBanc.
Leo Mariani
Just a question here around oil cut. If I’m looking at this right, in terms of your 2020 guidance, I’m seeing about a 66% oil cut this year. It looked like it’d be about 64% in Q4, and again, about 64% in the first quarter. So just wanted to get a sense of how that sort of evolves throughout the year and what’s kind of driving that improvement?
Jack Harper
Yes, the mid-60s, plus or minus, is due to our capital allocation across the basin is what we see, and it should be pretty steady at that level.
Will Giraud
Selling the shelf was a gassy asset.
Leo Mariani
Okay. And I guess, just from the perspective of looking at our 2020 production guidance and comparing that with kind of where you guys were in the fourth quarter. If I kind of back out the shelf sale in the fourth quarter of 2019, I mean, it looks like 2020 is kind of expected to be sort of flattish with fourth quarter, but I guess down a little bit in the first quarter of 2020. Just kind of wanted to get a little color on that. I mean, I guess do you guys just see production starting to pick up in terms of the growth coming in, in the second quarter? And I guess, just overall, I mean, looking at that kind of level there? It seemed like maybe there was a little conservatism in those numbers?
Tim Leach
Sure, Leo. Yes, just to kind of recap, I mean, if you take the shelf out of the year. For 2019, we’re projecting to grow our oil rates in 2020 a little more than 10%. And so that – I think your question really is about the cadence of that growth because you point correctly to that fourth quarter number, we reported 215 MBoepd. If you take the shelf out, then it’s about 210 MBoepd.
And our first quarter guide at the high end is essentially flat with that number, so I wouldn’t read too much into that. There’s a little bit just inter-quarter noise around the first quarter. There’s probably more completion or more wells put on production in the back half of the quarter than the front. But as Jack has mentioned, the theme of steady should be the way you think about 2020’s growth.
Leo Mariani
Okay. That’s helpful color. And I guess, just on your dividend versus buyback, you guys had a pretty significant buyback activity in the fourth quarter. I know part of that was driven by the shelf sale. You’ve obviously boosted the dividend aggressively here in 2020, which is great to see. You should have quite a bit of other free cash flow. Are you guys going to still stay aggressive on the buyback here in 2020? Or do you guys kind of view that high fourth quarter buyback as a little bit more onetime in nature?
Jack Harper
Well, we talked about using the proceeds from the sale of the Shelf to fund buybacks, and we did that. And I would say that we also talked about the various levels of free cash flow that are possible between $50 and $60 oil. And one of the greatest uses of that amount of free cash flow will be opportunistic stock buybacks. So…
Leo Mariani
Okay. Thanks, guys.
Jack Harper
Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question will come from Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research.
Bob Brackett
Hey, good morning. I’m intrigued by Slide 15 in the deck where you talk about your horizontal wells drilled by zone and formation. And there’s a bit of two questions here. One is there’s a mix shift between, say, your pre-2018 program and the current program, for example, in the Delaware, from the second Bone Springs into the Wolfcamp A; and for the Midland, from the Wolfcamp A into the Lower Spraberry. Question is, what drives that shift, assuming that you’re trying to maximize the IRR of every well you drill?
Will Giraud
Sure, Bob. I mean, there’s a variety of things driving that. In the Delaware, one of them is just trying to target the oiliest zones with the backdrop we have in terms of natural gas pricing and NGL pricing. So there’s some aspect of that, but also, it’s just – in the Midland Basin, as you talk about this different Spraberry intervals, the rates of return there have been superior for us than many of the Wolfcamp zones in the Midland Basin, so capital has moved that way as well.
Bob Brackett
And how do I think about prospectivity? Should I use sort of the level of activity in the last couple of years as a measure of how good the zones are? Or is that too simplistic?
Jack Harper
I think that’s probably too simplistic. I mean, part of this is, as Tim has talked about before, over the last couple of years, there’s always been an element of exploration in our program, where we’ve tried to continue testing other zones with the knowledge that if you don’t go get them now, you may or may not be able to get them in the same way later.
And so we continue to kind of try and figure out the exact right answer on that. I think one lesson from 2019 is especially in a $50-oil environment, we’re going to have less risk tolerance in terms of doing that here in 2020, but it’s still an important question to answer for the long-term.
Bob Brackett
Okay, thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question will come from Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Brothers.
Jeffrey Campbell
Good morning and congratulations on the quarter and the year. I noticed with interest in CapEx is now split 50-50 between the Delaware Basin and Midland Basin as opposed to 60-40 in 2019. I just wondered what was driving the increased capital allocation to the Midland Basin?
Tim Leach
Hey, Jeffrey. I wouldn’t read too much into that. I mean, our capital allocation process definitely looks a lot like what we have done in previous years, which is that the teams compete with each other for capital, based on a rate of return basis and also kind of the long-term ROI. And so 60-40, 50-50, are generally similar numbers to me.
Jeffrey Campbell
Okay. Thank you. I appreciate that. And on Slide 12, going back to the flaring. Obviously, a lot of improvement there. I just wondered, is there a physical constraint to further reducing the flaring? And if so, how is that going to be resolved?
Tim Leach
That’s the result of a very intentional effort on our part. There’s a lot of push, obviously, on the industry and from within the industry to continue to move that number down. So that’s a big focal point here.
Jeffrey Campbell
Well, I guess what I was asking was, do we need any further pipeline development to reduce the flaring? I mean, is there some specific physical constraint or physical catalyst that’s going to help push that down any further?
Jack Harper
Yes. We are – to answer your one question, yes, there does need to be additional pipeline development, and there are, fortunately, a couple in the queue. As for now, we are happy with our providers and our agreements, and we are moving all of our guests. And we don’t anticipate any change to our program in 2020 based on constraints.
Jeffrey Campbell
Okay, great. Thank you. I appreciate it.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question will come from David Deckelbaum with Cowen.
David Deckelbaum
Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to just go – just wanted to go back real quickly to the conversation around the split or allocation between Midland and Delaware. Did that capital allocation process change in 2020 versus what it was in 2019 being that sort of team-driven model? And I guess, as we think beyond 2020 – I know you said you don’t see a big difference between 60-40 and 50-50. Does that change precipitously over time as we get into 2021 and beyond?
Tim Leach
I don’t think so. This is Tim. I mean, we’re constantly learning new things about the program and our assets through the science that we’re doing and that informs and drives how we build future programs. And we’ve had great success on the Midland Basin side in certain zones that make those zones more competitive for capital. So – but I like having a balance between the two areas and the ability to move capital back and forth. Our New Mexico area still has some of the best rock in the entire world. And we’ll continue to get a large amount of capital allocated to it.
David Deckelbaum
I appreciate that. Are there specific areas that you drilled in 2019 that you are shifting capital away from – in 2020 in the Delaware?
Jack Harper
Not really. The only thing that’s shifting is the style of development and the spacing of the wells. But other than that, no.
David Deckelbaum
Okay. And just the last one I had, I know you guys have increased your – the number of locations, the lateral lengths on average by 7% this year, and you’re drilling a program in 2020 with averages of 10,000 feet. What does – how long does that sort of 10,000 foot average lateral length program extends for?
Will Giraud
Well, it’s dynamic. As we sit here today, you’ve got a lot of it still to do. But I think one of the challenges to our team is to continue to do the work on the asset side with acreage swaps, and otherwise, to extend that runway out as far as we can see.
David Deckelbaum
Got it. But as we stand today, if we were to allocate like a 2021 program, it would be somewhat similar, I guess?
Will Giraud
Yes. I mean, I don’t want to get into modeling it, but we should be able to do 10,000 foot laterals for a long time.
David Deckelbaum
Thank you, guys.
Will Giraud
Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question will come from Matt Portillo with TPH.
Matt Portillo
Good morning, all.
Tim Leach
Good morning.
Matt Portillo
Tim, just a follow-up question on the dividend policy going forward, assuming crude generally holds around $50 to $60 WTI. Is there a framework with which investors should be thinking about the dividend as it relates to progression and growth?
Jack Harper
Well, yes, I would say that the difference between $50 and $60 and free cash flow is large, but as I’ve stated, we view our – the dividend is the first call on our cash flow and capital, and that we want to grow that dividend in a compelling and competitive way. So as the company is able to grow, I think that dividend, you got to expect it to grow over time as well.
Matt Portillo
Perfect. And then a follow-up question as it relates to the shift in the business model that you mentioned over the last few years, targeting in more of a moderated growth program with growing free cash flow over time. Could you potentially talk about any directional color on how CapEx might progress over the next few years if crude is to stay at or above $50 a barrel?
Jack Harper
Yes. I think that one of the important things, and we’ve said it several times on this call is that steady means efficiency. And so the growth of the capital spend, I think, will be very restrained. And in fact, this year’s capital spend is less than last year’s, and we’re getting more from that capital that we’re spending, more lateral feet. It’s a tremendous driver in efficiency and in our margins and things like that. So I think that – and expect that the capital program going forward will – the growth of that will be very muted, and – but the results you see from it ought to grow.
Matt Portillo
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question will come from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.
Paul Cheng
Thank you. Can you hear me?
Jack Harper
We can.
Paul Cheng
Okay, thank you. Sorry, that – I think last time I had some problem with the phone. I have to apologize first because I missed the first six or seven minutes of the call. So if my question has already been addressed, please let me know. If I look at longer term, I think a lot of investors, especially in the value side, they would like to have a more clear road map in terms of how the future cash flow is being used. So wondering that as the company shifts more towards into the free cash flow and the return model, do you have a target how much is the percent or the ratio of your cash flow you’re going to reinvest in the business? And how much do you expect that to return to the shareholder?
Jack Harper
Sure. We’ve laid out our framework in a slide pretty well here that we expect a $50 oil, plus or minus, to be able to grow our business and generate increasing amounts of free cash flow. But the points in the cycle, when the price goes above that, not chasing that price and letting all the free cash come back to see the shareholders either in the form of a dividend or a buyback. And so that’s the underlying framework that I think you should expect. And as Tim just mentioned, that can improve with better efficiencies and getting more for less.
Paul Cheng
At $50, do you have a, say, target? How much is the free cash that you want to generate over time as a percentage?
Tim Leach
Well, you can see what we’re doing in 2020 at $50, and my expectation is that we should be able to improve from that level going forward.
Paul Cheng
Okay. So $350 million is the baseline that we should use and assume that you’re going to do better in the future and then that bank lenient to what is the CapEx that you may use.
Jack Harper
Okay.
Paul Cheng
Long-term, do you have a target production growth now. I think at one point in the past that you’re talking about 15%. And for this year, that, say, 10% to 12% oil growth, 6% to 8% on the total volume growth, is that a reasonable target growth rate in the future on the longer term?
Jack Harper
Yes. As we’ve described many times, we’re searching for that optimal mix of growth in free cash flow. You can see what the output of that is in 2020. And beyond that, we will see what the circumstances hold.
Paul Cheng
Yes. Thank you. I would just make one comment then. I think for the investors, they would want to see a higher free cash flow than a higher growth rate, given the growth, the investors are no longer here. I don’t think that the market will want any company going, say, call it, beyond 10% and more? Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question will come from Gail Nicholson with Stephens.
Gail Nicholson
Good morning. Just a standpoint of the hedge book, you guys have a very healthy hedge book this year. With the continued volatility that we have experienced in the commodity, has your hedging strategy changed at all, in the standpoint of what you feel is needed from a hedge protection on a go-forward basis?
Jack Harper
Our strategy really hasn’t changed. I mean, the basis of this strategy is hedging the PDP volumes out for a couple of cycles, for 12 to 24 months. That’s the basis. The tactics have changed, where we’ve got the waterborne volumes that you hedge that a little bit differently. We’ve talked about – in the past, we didn’t hedge gas and NGL so much. You’ve seen us being more active with that, thankfully. And so – but the basic strategy is still the same. And it’s not to assume that we know which direction commodity prices are going. It’s just to take some of the risk and volatility of our cash flow in the short-term.
Gail Nicholson
Great, thank you. And then in regards to LOE, when we look at potential future improvements, is that more water cost savings driven? Is there incremental savings from electricity that’s being put in, a switch from EPS to gas lift? Or just can you talk about just kind of some of the projects that are being implemented in 2020 to further improve the LOE cost?
Will Giraud
Sure. I mean, the water piece is probably a net neutral. To the extent we’re doing those transactions, it’s at a market rate. And so it shouldn’t have much of an impact either way on LOE. As it relates to just broader improvement in LOE, I would say that it’s going to come through the aggregation of a whole lot of small efforts as opposed to any one big gain. I mean, as compasses and electrical infrastructure is built out, you need less generators as time passes and technology helps you improve things on the productivity side with automation and otherwise. There’s definitely long-term opportunity there, but it’s going to be a grind.
Gail Nicholson
Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question will come from Josh Silverstein with Wolfe Research.
Josh Silverstein
Thanks. Good morning, guys. Just on the capital budget for this year, maybe just a clarification there. Is the $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion all in? I’m asking because you guys have historically put some capital into midstream projects, have added some – or spent some dollars on the acreage additions? So just wanted to see if we should be thinking about any additional capital beyond that level?
Jack Harper
Yes, the – any additional capital beyond that should be pretty minimal. So I think that’s the way you should look at it. In terms of the specific items you have mentioned, the same percentages hold that we’ve talked about in the past for infrastructure and non-exploration and development capital. They are included in that number, the $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion.
Josh Silverstein
Got it. So like, they are roughly 150-ish or so that you spent over the last couple of years, that’s in that number for this year now?
Will Giraud
Yes, it’s kind of that 7% to 10% of the total.
Josh Silverstein
Got it. Okay. Thanks for that. And then just on the cost structure, but between the two basins, obviously, there’s a big decline expected in the Delaware this year. Just curious where the leading edge is right now? And is there any reason to think why the Delaware couldn’t get below the Midland entering 2021?
Will Giraud
Well, I do think the forward guidance we’re giving there on the DC&E per foot reflects kind of the environment as we see it in 4Q and projects it as being steady across 2020. I think if you looked at the breakout between that number. The Delaware Basin is probably $100 a foot higher on average and the Midland Basin is about $100 a foot lower on average. And while they have had similar drivers in terms of causing that number to come down over time and there has been dramatic improvement in the Delaware, especially around some of our things we’re doing on the drill side, I do expect the Delaware number just structurally to stay higher because of depths and pressures.
Josh Silverstein
Got it. Thanks, guys.
Will Giraud
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Noel Parks with Coker & Palmer.
Noel Parks
Good morning. Can you hear me?
Jack Harper
Yes, good morning.
Noel Parks
Okay, great. Thanks. In your comments earlier today, you were talking about next-gen frac equipment. And I was curious, do you view the sort of next stage of efficiency more being on the equipment side as opposed to the frac recipe side going forward?
Jack Harper
Well, I’ll let Will jump in on this in detail. But I would say efficiencies come in small bites everywhere. And that’s been the case for a long time. So I would expect everything to get more efficient over time.
Will Giraud
Yes. No, that’s – I agree. And what we’re really trying to highlight there is just the move to this dual fuel, including 1 Tier for a fleet. We think that’s another opportunity to keep driving costs down to the extent you’re burning compressed natural gas or even field gas in your fleet instead. And so we’re pushing on that side pretty hard.
Noel Parks
Great. And you’ve done a lot as far as lateral lengths as you’ve described. But I’m wondering, for those remaining areas where you – your leases leave you having to do short lateral, how much of a compromise in returns or efficiency do you have at this point with a shorter lateral?
Will Giraud
I mean, we’re trying pretty hard to not drill one-mile laterals. But I mean, the uptick from going to one-mile to two is very significant. I mean, on order of magnitude, it can double the rate of return.
Noel Parks
Okay. And are there any differences, and I guess, stimulation effect in this or anything? I’m thinking about – with the longer laterals, of course, you have a sort of more complex completion. You have the issues that some things happen at the tow, the welcome here to on a shorter lateral, are those factored at all?
Will Giraud
I mean, I wouldn’t say just flat no, but technology is fixed, most of the big problems using dissolvable plugs to the extents you’re going beyond two miles for the tow and some of those types of things. But broadly, the answer is no. The effectiveness is the same.
Noel Parks
Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Richard Tullis with Capital One Securities.
Richard Tullis
Thanks, good morning. Most of my questions have been asked, but just one last one for Tim or Jack. It’s been, I guess, a little more than a year since the RSP acquisition closed, any one or two items stand out at this point that may have surprised to the upside or maybe even cause some disappointment compared to the initial thoughts at the time of the acquisition?
Tim Leach
No, it’s a great combination of like assets. I still think size, scale and blockiness of our acreage position is very important. And you can see that through the efficiency numbers that we’re continuing to gain. It also allowed us the sale of the shelf and continued to high-grade our properties just makes us better company.
Richard Tullis
Thank you. That’s helpful. And lastly, just thanks for the detail in the presentation on the different cost components. I think that’s helpful. That’s all for me.
Tim Leach
Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. And our final question will come from Jeanine Wai with Barclays.
Jeanine Wai
Hi, good morning, everyone.
Tim Leach
Good morning.
Jeanine Wai
Good morning. I wanted to follow up on some of the dividend questions. You announced that nice dividend increase. And in terms of just understanding it a little better, for the dividend coverage, at what oil price are you comfortable with? You’ve got a really strong hedge book program this year that puts a lot of protection. And on the downside, it also makes the breakeven pretty low, at five below $50 WTI. But what about unhedged and maybe as a follow-up to that going forward, since this strip is pretty flat at 51% for hedging purposes, where do you feel comfortable for 2021 and 2022 coverage?
Jack Harper
Yes. And starting in 2020, we feel comfortable that sub-$45 oil, we can cover our capital plan and that dividend. So that gives us comfort this year to whether anything that may come. And if oil looks like it’s going to be lower for longer, below that price, we will modify our capital plan. Going forward, I think, just philosophically, the way to think about the dividend is that it should represent an increasing percentage of our cash flow, and it should most likely outpace our growth in production.
Jeanine Wai
Okay, great. Thank you for taking my questions.
Operator
Thank you. I’m showing no further questions in the queue at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Tim Leach for any further remarks.
