Thank you, Keith good morning everyone. The fourth quarter was a solid earning to the first full year of our transformation journey. For the full year, Yum! delivered 5% system sales growth, excluding the impact of the 53rd week. This is comprised of 2% same store sales growth and 3% net new unit growth. We've reached a significant milestone in 2017 as we closed the year with over 45,000 global restaurants in our 139 countries and territories. We are excited about the long-term growth potential of Yum! brands and are on track with our strategic transformation initiatives. 
Today, I will talk you about two of our four growth capabilities. Distinctive relevant and easy brands and unrivaled culture and talent. Then David will follow up with this second too. While at the restaurant development and unmatched franchise operating capability, he will also discuss our 2017 results, 2018 guidance and progress towards our transformation initiatives. 
I'll begin with our distinctive relevant and easy brands. There is no better way to make a brand easy than having it deliver right to your door. And I'm very excited to announce a new U.S. partnership with Grubhub. As the nation's leading online and mobile food ordering company, Grubhub offers delivery in over 1300 U.S. cities. This partnership will rapidly expand KFC and Taco Bell's ability to offer the online ordering by pickup and delivery to our customers in all existing U.S. Grubhub markets with many more to come. Making it easy to access all of our brands is important and the partnership with Grubhub is a key component of making our brands distinctive, relevant and easy. 
Now on to the brands. Starting with KFC, where system sales grew 6% excluding the 53rd week, with 3% same store sales growth and 4% net new unit growth in the fourth quarter. Internationally, we had several standout markets and I'd like to highlight two, Russia and Brazil. In our Russia market, system sales grew 26% in the quarter with 9% same store sales growth and 18% net new unit growth. The market strong growth has been supported by their marketing focus on value and core. Unit development is also strong with 2017 being the fourth year in a row that the Russia market opened at least 1000 new stores. This success is driven by the utilization of technology-based development strategies, controlled growth through development agreements and new access formats. 
In Brazil, same store sales increased 21% for the quarter and 18% for the year, with significant media coverage, value offerings and an operational focus on win on types objectives the market delivered strong results. Brazil also focused on reducing costs and enhancing the supply chain distribution to ensure value products are financially feasible. 
Now to the US where we saw increased pressure from competitors on chicken innovation and value in the fourth quarter, with same store sales declining 1% but still finishing the year with our fourth consecutive year of same store sales and traffic growth. While disappointed in our results for the quarter, we are bullish on 2018 with marketing trends around both value and innovation. 
We started the year with our valued coronel [ph] and now have our first female coronel [indiscernible] showcasing innovation with our new smoking mountain barbeque flavor. This builds off the other familiar flavor that you’ve already seen such as National Hot and Georgia Gold and gives an exciting and operationally easy way to bring new flavors to existing products. 
Additionally, we continue remodeling our asset base with plans to remodel another 600 stores in 2018 resulting in nearly 40% of the asset base being at current image by year end. We are excited about our plan for 2018 and confident that this will be our fifth consecutive year of positive signs for sales growth. 
Next the Pizza Hut, in the US, same stores sales grew 2% in the fourth quarter demonstrating the strength of our Longlines systems through the transformation agreement and building momentum in the business. Pizza Hut remains committed to ensuring every customer has a hot, fast and reliable experience. The hot experience begins with 145,000 new thermal pouches which deliver your pizza 15
