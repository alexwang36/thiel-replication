Richard McKenney
Great. Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. It was a busy fourth quarter for all, with the initial impacts from the enactments of tax reform reflected in our financial results. Through this, I am very pleased with our underlying results, which continued many of the positive trends we have seen throughout 2017.
Our net income for the quarter was $1.19 per share compared to $1.07 a share in the year ago fourth quarter. Adjusting for tax reform, a settlement on unclaimed death benefits and the net investment gains on our investment portfolio, our adjusted operating income per share was $1.13, up 14% compared to $0.99 in the year ago quarter.
I would note that this result includes a reserve release in our individual disability line of business, resulting from our annual review of reserves, which benefited our adjusted operating income by $0.06 per share. Overall, this was an excellent quarter for the company and a strong finish to the year.
The drivers of these strong results remain consistent throughout the year and again through the fourth quarter. We saw solid top-line growth in our core businesses and excellent operational performance. From a growth perspective in the fourth quarter, we experienced 4% growth in premium income for our core, with 3% premium growth in Unum US, 6% in Colonial Life and 2% for Unum UK in local currency.
A highlight was that that our fourth quarter sales were also very strong, particularly in our US business, where Unum US posted 28% year over year growth, and Colonial Life increased sales by 10.4%, giving us confidence that our premium growth trends can continue in 2018. With the sales growth, we have been firm in our underwriting discipline and we expect to continue to drive strong profit margins in our core business segments.
Our optimism for 2018 is further enhanced with the enactment of tax reform legislation, as Unum will be a significant beneficiary. From a GAAP earnings perspective, our tax rate will decline substantially from a 31% to 32% rate we have been reporting to a new expectation in 2018 of 19% to 21%.
This will also create additional cash flow in 2018, which will accelerate over time. While we expect much of the benefit will accrue to our shareholders, we also expect opportunities for enhanced investment in many aspects of our business. This includes infrastructure and technology spending to better serve the needs of our customers, further investment in our workforce, and finally, investment in and support for the communities that we call home.
And finally, we're looking to see how tax reform drives accelerated economic growth in the broader U.S. economy. For us, employment growth and wage inflation mean incremental growth for our customers and our business. Our optimism is also evident in our announcement last week of the acquisition of Pramerica
