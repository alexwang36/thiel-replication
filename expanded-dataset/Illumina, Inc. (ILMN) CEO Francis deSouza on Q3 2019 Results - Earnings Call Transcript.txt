Thank you, Jackie, and good afternoon, everyone.
Illumina reported a solid third quarter with revenue up $907 million driven by 12% growth in our Sequencing business, more than offsetting a 24% decline in arrays revenue. Total revenue included more than $30 million associated with IVD licensing agreement which was previously anticipated in the fourth quarter. Sequencing systems and sequencing consumable revenue was largely in line with expectation. 
Sequencing consumable revenue of $525 million grew 11% compared to the third quarter of 2018. Exceeding $0.5 billion for the first time in the company’s history. Year-over-year dollar growth of $53 million reflected consumable growth for every system in our sequencing family excluding HiSeq. High
