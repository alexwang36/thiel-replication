Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Boston Scientific Q1 2020 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.
I will now turn the call over to your host, Susan Lisa. Please go ahead.
Susan Lisa
Thank you very much, Kevin, and for those explicit directions. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q1 2020 results, which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release, as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Financials & Filings. 
The duration of this morning's call will be approximately one hour. Mike will focus the majority of his comments on the impact of COVID-19, inclusive of April trends and procedural acuity by business. Dan will review the financials for the quarter and our liquidity outlook and then we'll take your questions. During today's Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officers, Dr. Ian Meredith and Dr. Ken Stein.
Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that on the call, operational revenue excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, and organic revenue further excludes the impact of certain acquisitions, including Vertiflex and BTG in the relevant periods for which there are no prior period-related net sales, as well as the divestiture of the global embolic microspheres portfolio. On this call, all references to sales and revenue unless otherwise specified are organic.
Also of note, this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, believe, estimate and other similar words. They include, among other things, the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the company's result of operations; statements about our growth and market share; new product approvals and launches; clinical trials; cost savings and growth opportunities; our cash flow and expected use; our financial performance, including sales, margins and earnings; as well as our tax rates, R&D spend, and other expenses. April trends refer to month-to-date results and actual results may differ materially from those discussed in these and any forward-looking statements. 
Factors that may cause such differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them.
At this point, I'll turn it over to Mike for his comments.
Michael Mahoney
Thank you, Susie. Thank you to everyone for joining us today. I hope that you and your families are healthy and braving the COVID-19 pandemic as well as possible. 
I'm truly honored to be part of Boston Scientific as I see every day the resilience of our employees across the globe, who are helping us to navigate the crisis and emerge stronger on the other side. We're humbled to be able to continue to serve our customers, patients, employees and community amid COVID-19 pandemic. 
Our focus is to communicate with transparency and take actions consistent with our core values, while keeping employees safe and informed, providing patient support to customers and effectively managing our operations. 
We've expanded our capabilities in virtual physician education, remote clinical support, digital sales enablement and training. We're also partnering with our customers to enable a fast recovery, while also acting to reduce operational expenses and preserving our cash position. We have taken these immediate actions with the goal to preserve as many jobs and strategic programs as possible. 
We've also leveraged our capability to develop countermeasure technologies, such as the Coventor personal respirator, which was developed and approved in just four weeks, as well as face shields and donations of personal protective equipment. 
I'll now provide some highlights on first quarter 2020 and we'll focus most of my comments on the impact of COVID-19. While we're not providing specific revenue and EPS guidance at this point, we will offer insights into our segments, along with recent businesses and geographic sales trends and highlight some 2020 launches. I'll then wrap up with some key sustainability updates as our teams continue their dedication to innovation and long-term commitments to the environment and our communities. 
For the first quarter of 2020, total company sales grew 3.2% on an operational basis, with US up 3%, EMEA up 1% and Asia-Pac down 5% operationally. Total sales declined 2.9% on an organic basis, reflecting the impact from COVID-19 and in line with our April 2 pre-announcement.
Sales are tracking to expectations in both January and February before significant negative trends kicked in in mid-March. These first quarter sales results were led by low-single digit growth in our MedSurg segment, with uro/pelvic health up 3%, endo up 2%, then both our cardiovascular and rhythm and neuro segments declined organically. Within cardiovascular, interventional cardiology sales were down 3%, peripheral interventions was down 2%.
Operationally within PI, BTG interventional medicines contributed 390 basis points to total company growth, led by TheraSpheres which grew mid-teens in the quarter.
In rhythm and neuro, CRM sales declined 10%, EP dropped 5% and neuromodulation declined 7%. Neuromod did grow 3% operationally, with a 70 basis points contribution to company sales from Vertiflex. And specialty pharma sales up $41 million was ahead of forecast and contributed 160 basis points to total company growth. 
Despite taking immediate actions to reduce costs, the lower overall sales levels led to a challenge P&L for the quarter as adjusted operating margin fell to 21.6%, down 400 basis points year-over-year, and adjusted EPS of $0.28, which is a 21% decline versus Q1 2019. 
Now to turn to outlook for the rest of the year. As I mentioned, Q1 sales were tracking to expectations until mid-March when we started to see significant declines in US and European revenue as a result of procedure deferrals in those geographies across all of our businesses. 
Generally, those negative trends in the second half of March have continued in the first three weeks of April. We're currently planning for the most significant negative impact of COVID-19 in Q2. And within Q2, we expect April to be the toughest month with global revenue for the month of April down approximately 45% to 50%. 
From a regional perspective, we see varying results based on the different phases of recovery. Through the first three weeks of April, regional sales results have trended down 15% in Asia-Pac, down 45% in Europe, Middle East, East Africa, and down 55% in the US versus prior year. 
Importantly, we've seen a very recent slight improvement in April sales trends as some facilities, to varying degrees, have begun to reopen for elective procedures. We anticipate some sequential monthly improvement throughout Q2, but with net sales results still down significantly year-over-year for the second quarter. 
We also expect Q3 revenue will likely contract on a year-over-year basis, but improve from Q2 rates of decline. And then, we aim to return to growth in Q4, but there are obviously still many uncertainties.
Despite the procedure volume impact from COVID-19, the global pipeline across our businesses remain very strong, with several ongoing launches and recent approvals now poised for commercialization as soon as the broader environment improves. 
I'll also provide color on procedural urgency along with trends in April. We've framed our major product lines across the spectrum from emergent, which is measured in hours to days, to semi emergent, which is measured in weeks, to elective which is measured in months. And note that several product families cross over categories, and majority of conditions we treat have relatively high levels of acuity, including those that are elective, and thus generally can't be deferred for extended periods. 
In addition, when estimating the overall pace of recovery, site of service is an important consideration. And the recent guidelines for reopening from a range of physician societies enable elective outpatient procedures to restart before inpatient procedures.
Site of service varies by business, but, overall, based on 2018 Medicare claims data, our 2019 US revenue split was approximately one-third inpatient and two-thirds outpatient. The two-thirds mix within the outpatient setting spans across hospital outpatient, physician office labs and ambulatory surgery centers. Please refer to slide 12 of our Investor Relations website for supporting details to the commentary.
For urology/pelvic health, given the high mix of deferrable procedures, trends through the first three weeks of April were down roughly 60% versus prior year, with sales from our stone franchise and SpaceOAR products showing better resilience and more pressure on our prostate health, prosthetic urology and pelvic floor franchises. We believe the uro/PH may have one of the faster potential recovery curves aided by a higher office ASE mix for our most elective procedures, as well as specific products playing a key role, such as the recent launch of the Tria stents in the US and Europe.
And LithoVue, which is our single use ureteroscope, could benefit as the current environment supports the speed and utility of single use scopes. 
SpaceOAR is also an important technology for the recovery as treatments for cancer patients will be prioritized and hydrogel spacing is now included in NCCN guidelines.
