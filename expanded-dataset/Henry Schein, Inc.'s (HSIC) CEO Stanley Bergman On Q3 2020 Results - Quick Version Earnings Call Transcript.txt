[00:00:03] Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Henry Shine third quarter Twenty twenty conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session and instructions will follow at that time if anyone should require assistance. During the call me press the star key followed by zero on your touchtone phone. As a reminder this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Carolyn Borders. Henry Shine, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Carolyn.
Carolynne Borders
[00:00:34] Thank you, Regina. My thanks to each of you for joining us to discuss Henry Shine's results for the third quarter of Twenty twenty. With me on the call today are Stanley Bergman, chairman of the board and Chief Executive Officer of Henry Shine, and Steven Palladino, executive vice president and Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to state that certain comments made during this call will include information that is forward looking. As you know, risks and uncertainties involved in the company's business may affect the matters referred to in forward looking statements. As a result, the company's performance may materially differ from those expressed in or indicated by such forward looking statements. These forward looking statements are qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained in Henry Shine's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the risk factors section of those filings. In addition, all comments about the markets we serve, including end market growth rates and market share, are based upon the company's internal analysis and estimates. Our conference call remarks will include both gap and non gap financial results. We believe the non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable the comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independently of business performance and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.
[00:02:06] These non gap financial measures are presented solely for informational and comparative purposes and should not be regarded as a replacement for corresponding gap measures. Reconciliations between gap and non gap measures can be found in the supplemental information section of our Investor Relations website and an Exhibit B of today's press release, which is available in the investor relations section of our website, as well as the content of this conference call contains time sensitive information that is accurate only as of the date of the live broadcast November 2nd, Twenty twenty Henry Shine undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances. After the date of this call, please limit yourself to a single question and a follow up during Q&A to allow as many listeners as possible to ask a question within the one hour that we have a lot of for this call. And with that said, I would like to turn the call over to Stanley birdmen.
Stanley Bergman
[00:03:08] Good morning, everyone on. And thank you, everyone, for calling in to today's call. Needless to say, Twenty twenty has been an extraordinarily challenging and unpredictable year for our team, customers and, of course, suppliers. I commend the work and sacrifice of Team Shine to support business continuity for our customers. The pandemic caused disruption to supply chain as suppliers reacted to increased demand for PPE in particular and other products as well, and shortages of raw materials were experienced throughout the marketplace, both domestically and international lead for much of the for many of the products, shall we say, that we offer as a result of the hard work and dedication of the team throughout the covid-19 crisis. We were ready to assist our dental and medical customers deal with emergencies, while many of whom were subject to restrictions and face severe challenges as they then returned to their offices to provide safe, quality clinical care. Clearly, the covid-19 pandemic continues to present challenges and uncertainties for the global economy and our customers, we remain confident that we have a solid long term strategy in place, supported by a strong balance sheet and significant access to liquidity. The strong rebound in sales that began late in the second quarter continued into the third quarter with growth over the prior year driven by sales of EPS and covid-19 related products.
[00:04:48] This growth, coupled with the various actions we took earlier in the year to reduce operating expenses, resulted in diluted EPS that grew eight point eight percent on a gap basis and fourteen point four percent on a non-GAAP basis. As noted in our as noted, our Q3 EPS growth also reflected the various actions we took earlier in the year to reduce operating expenses. Most of these temporary expense reduction initiatives have now ended. We remain committed to the well-being of Team Shine and our disciplined strategy that is focused on the success of our customers, helping practitioners efficiently manage practices while providing quality care as the driver of long term profitable growth for the company, given the challenging macro environment that started with the onset of the pandemic early this year. We posed our longstanding program of strategic acquisitions it as a global business. Conditions have improved. We have resumed these activities. We now believe we have significant opportunities to allocate capital in support of our strategic plan with a goal of maintaining a strong balance sheet and continuing to increase operating cash flow over time. As we prepare to exit twenty twenty, we will redefine our strategic plan with the goal of having. Well refined, so we will refine our strategic plan with the goal of having our strategic plan in place for Twenty twenty two, three, Twenty twenty four will continue to focus on a number of key initiatives, which include.
[00:06:34] Increasing customer penetration organically and through acquisition, geographic expansion, including into the developing world, advancing technology solutions centered on software, including patient communications, leading the digitization of medical dental offices, including interoperability to devices and prosthetics, and expanding our specialty segment and solutions offering all while advancing our dental business globally and our medical business globally as well. Our team, including telesales, customer service and our distribution centers, remained open, fully operational during this period and have done an extraordinary job throughout this covid-19 crisis of processing ongoing high volume of orders received and ensuring they ship quickly to our customers. Those certainly can use a pistol relatively tight, supply wise and commanding someone of a higher price. We believe the general market has stabilized and we will strive to maintain, as we had throughout the crisis, fair pricing for our customers at this time. I'll hand the call over to Stephen to discuss our recent financial performance and then I'll provide some additional commentary on our views of the current business conditions in the markets we serve as. Stephen, please.
Steven Paladino
[00:08:06] Ok, thank you, Stanley, and good morning to all. As we begin, I'd like to point out that I will be discussing our results from continuing operations on an as reported basis and also on an ongoing basis. Our Q3 Twenty twenty and Q3 twenty nineteen non-GAAP results exclude certain items that are detailed in Exhibit B of today's press release and in the supplemental information section of our Investor Relations website. Please note that we have again included a corporate sales category for Q3 that represents sales to Vestris under the Transitional Services Agreement. As we stated, our intention on our last earnings call that essentially all remaining TSMC members have returned from furlough and from reduced work hours. We will continue to closely monitor the health of our business and remain prepared to take additional cost saving measures if necessary. Turning to our financial results, net sales for the quarter ended September 26 Twenty twenty with two point eight dollars billion, reflecting an increase of thirteen point two percent compared to the prior year with internally generated sales growth of thirteen point zero percent in local currencies. PPE and covid-19 related products sales accounted for nearly all of the growth in our sales this quarter, although we expect PPY and covid-19 related product sales to positively impact dental and medical consumable merchandise sales in the future.
[00:09:40] We also expect overall sales growth to moderate from the third quarter. Details about sales performance are contained in Exhibit A of our earnings press release that was issued earlier today on a gap basis, our operating margin for the third quarter of twenty twenty six point six percent, representing a decrease of eighty five basis points compared to the prior year. On an ongoing basis, our operating margin of six point nine percent contracted by 58 basis points on a year over year basis. A reconciliation of gap operating margin for non gap operating operating margin can also be found in the supplemental information page on our Investor Relations website. Operating margin was primarily negatively impacted by Cygnet significant inventory adjustments associated with PPA and covid-19 related products. This was offset by reduced expenses driven by our previously mentioned cost reduction initiatives that were put in place earlier in the year in response to the Cauvin pandemic. These temporary cost reduction initiatives will not have a significant impact on Q4 results, as most of these measures, such as furloughs, reduce work hours and salary reductions, are no longer in place.
[00:10:58] Turning to taxes are reported gap effective tax rate for the third quarter of twenty twenty with sixteen point four percent. This compares with a twenty three point five percent cap effective tax rate for the third quarter of twenty nineteen. On an ongoing basis, our effective tax rate was sixteen point seven percent and this compares with the prior year non-GAAP effective tax rate of twenty three point five percent. The lower tax rate in the third quarter was favorably impacted by US federal income tax settlement, which low income tax expense by approximately fifteen point six million dollars for 11 cents per diluted share. Excluding this impact, the rate would have been in the twenty five percent range on both the gap and then on that basis, moving on gap net income from continuing operations attributable to Henry Sean for the third quarter of twenty twenty was one hundred forty one point seven dollars million for ninety nine cents per diluted share. And this compares with prior year gap net income from continuing operations of one hundred and thirty four point nine million when ninety one cents per diluted share. The nonstop net income from continuing operations for the third quarter of Twenty twenty was one hundred and forty seven point zero million dollars, or one dollars three cents per diluted share. And this compares with the non-cash net income from continuing operations of one hundred thirty four point three million or 90 cents per diluted share for the quarter.
[00:12:28] On a continuing operation basis, amortization of acquired intangible assets for CUFI Twenty twenty was twenty five point two million dollars or 13 cents per diluted share, and that compares to twenty nine point five million pretax or 15 cents per diluted share in the same period last year. For the first nine months of the year, analyzation from acquired intangible assets with seventy nine million dollars CPA or 41 cents per diluted share, and that compares to seventy nine point six million pretax or forty cents per diluted share for the same period last year. Foreign currency exchange did not have any material impact on acutely diluted EPS for the quarter. I mean, I provide some details on our sales results for the quarter and dental sales of one point six billion dollars through six point seven percent compared to the same period last year. But with internal sales growth of six point five percent in local currencies, our North American internal dental sales growth and local currencies with six point three percent, and that included growth of eight point one percent in dental consumable merchandise and point two percent growth in dental equipment. Internationally, identical internal sales are up in local currencies, with six point nine percent with growth of eleven point one percent and consumable dental merchandise and a six point nine percent decline in equipment sales again this quarter, again this quarter in North America and international dental merchandise growth was driven by strong P and covid-19 related product sales last quarter.
[00:14:07] We provided year over year PCE sales growth as well as PPY contribution to global dental sales for Q3. We have expanded that category to include other covid-19 related products as well. So this category now also includes Qualitest Solutions as well as he thermometer's. On that basis, Tassell, PPY and covid-19 related product sales in Q3 increased by one hundred and thirty percent compared to the prior year. And for comparison purposes, year over year, growth was nearly 35 percent in Q2. Turning to dental specialty products include the internal sales growth of global dental specialty products increased by six point five percent in local currencies, with very strong growth in North America at fourteen point eight percent. We believe this higher margin product category has solid growth potential over the long term. Our medical sales of one one billion dollars grew twenty seven point eight, twenty seven point eight percent compared to the same period last year, or twenty seven point seven percent in local currencies. That twenty seven point seven percent included a twenty seven point eight percent growth in North America and internationally, twenty point seven percent. Our medical sales results were driven also by continued strong demand for PPE and provide 19 related products, medical and covid-19 related products sales increased by approximately 600 percent compared to the prior year.
[00:15:42] For comparison purposes, the year over year growth for Q2 was two hundred percent. Turning now to our technology and value added services segment. Those sales were one hundred and thirty eight point four million dollars in the third quarter, an increase of zero point seven percent compared to the prior year, which reflects a decline of internally generated sales in local currencies of one point three percent. North American technology and value added services. Internal sales declined by two point two percent in local currencies and internationally, technology and value added services declined by nine point five percent in local currencies compared to the same period last year. The slight decline in technology and value added services sales. In local currencies was impacted by lower than historical patient flow, which resulted in lower Henry Chahine one transaction revenue. Additionally, our financial services revenue was negatively impacted by lower equipment sales volume. As we first discussed on our Q1 earnings call in early May, we temporarily suspended our share repurchase program as a means to preserve cash in response to the impact of covid on our business operations and also due to certain restrictions related to financial covenants. As of today, Henry Shian has two hundred one point two dollars million authorized for future repurchases of common stock.
[00:17:13] Currently, we also have access to significant liquidity, providing flexibility and financial stability in this challenging environment, our operating cash flow from continuing operations for the third quarter was two hundred sixty one point three dollars million, and that compares to two hundred twenty six point four dollars million for the third quarter of the year. The year over year increase was primarily due to both high and net income and improvements in working capital. As part of our previously disclosed restructuring initiative, we recorded a pretax charge in Q3 Twenty twenty of seven million dollars or four cents per diluted share. This restructuring charge primarily includes severance pay facility closing costs and reflects opportunities to reduce expenses, drive operating efficiencies and mitigate stranded costs. We continue to expect our restructuring initiative to continue through the end of the year. I conclude my remarks on the topic of financial guidance, again, due to the continued uncertainty surrounding covid-19 pandemic and its impact to our business operations. We are not providing financial guidance at this time. As a reminder, most about temporary expense reduction initiatives have now ended. And although we expect PPE and other covid-19 related product sales to positively impact dental and medical consumable merchandise sales in the future, we also expect overall sales growth to moderate from the third quarter. So with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Statman.
Stanley Bergman
[00:18:49] Thank you, Stephen. Let's review our business performance from the third quarter in recent weeks in October, starting with Daniel. In the third quarter, we saw growth in the US, Canada and throughout Europe in consumable merchandise with particular strength in France and Italy. The U.K. was the exception where the continued impact on covid-19 has led to slower patient traffic in markets of China, Australia, New Zealand and Brazil also recovered quite nicely from the penultimate, the pre pandemic, actually from the pandemic levels returning home almost to actually to the pandemic, to the pre pandemic levels during the third quarter. Our internal sales for consumable merchandise in local currencies in both North America and international markets were strong. At the eight point one and eleven point one growth, respectively, the growth, the growth was driven by sales of EPS and covid-19 related products, PPE and cowbird related products. Sales as a percentage of global sales were in the mid single digit percentages range prior to covid-19. Which grew to approximately 11 percent in the second quarter and in the third quarter, this contribution in general was approximately 10 percent. We continue to expect that people will constitute a meaningful portion of our dental sales going forward as safety protocols remain a necessity for both patients and dental offices and actually feel that dentists in general in the United States and abroad are handling infection control, sepsis control extremely well, and that there is an adequate amount of PPE available for these practitioners to continue to provide safe, safe environments with a very good infection control in these offices. On our dental specialty businesses, which is comprised of implants and the downticks and orthodontics sales and during the third quarter in the segment. We actually performed quite well, led by and Doneck product sales also implant sales were particularly strong in North America, where internal sales growth in local currencies increased by approximately 18 percent.
[00:21:35] Dental equipment sales in the third quarter continue to recover in North America, both traditional and high technology equipment, internal sales growth in local currencies was essentially flat. Within those categories, we experienced strong sales and laser products, albeit a small base and double digit growth in CAD cam equipment. This is the third quarter last year, whereas 2D and 3D imaging sales declined in the quarter. International equipment sales experience a mid single digit percentage decline. Sales in Europe declined for both traditional and high technology during the equipment during the third quarter as some practices deferred investment decisions. As I mentioned last quarter, we are seeing heightened interest from customers in the purification category where we have exclusive relationships specific with the case and to surgically clean air. And we also offer solutions from other manufacturing partners, including Vanaman, as light and dry shield. It's clear that practices of getting more efficient in seeing patients as they adjust to new protocols. The degree of increased efficiency is hard to determine at this time, but clearly the addition of safety protocols in the practice and driving efficiency are both at play. In particular, we believe there will be continued interest in equipment solutions that enhance productivity, which is particularly important as practices look to see more patients in a safe environment. So so in summary, substantially, all of the dental markets we serve strengthened relative to the second quarter as we progress through the third quarter with a month to month improvements in consumable merchandise sales, obviously driven by demand of people covid related products.
[00:23:39] So where are we at this point? Dental practices in North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand are open again for the most part as well, I might add, as a result, and patients are returning for care. China is essentially back to pre pandemic levels despite rising covid-19 diagnosed cases in North America and the growing number of European countries, including Germany, France, the U.K., Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Austria, Switzerland and Czech Republic of Poland.
[00:24:17] And also in Brazil, patients continue to visit the dentist. This is very encouraging, completely different to what it was in April, this practice that open and patients are visiting the dental practice very clearly, very, very different to April. And the demand for products, both consumables and equipment, remains. The latest survey data published by the American Dental Association for the US shows that dental practices are approximately 77 percent of pre covid-19 patients, although this is down approximately two percent versus the prior ADA survey, but not showing any material degradation in patient volume. I think we have to be careful reading anything into the swing of a couple of percentage points. Henry Shine's IT claims data also show that patients continue to return for a broad set of OK procedures. It is clear that in the United States, the public views dentistry as important. And although we do not have as finite a detailed information in Europe, we can see that in Europe, dentists are being viewed as important health care providers. Of course, the UK is the exception. With regulations have been such that. The visits to the dentist have been restricted, but the rest of Europe is essentially open for dentistry, actually, all the markets were in. So overall, we would characterize the current dental and markets as improving in some areas and continuing to stabilize in others.
[00:26:06] At this moment, this is exactly what we're seeing, of course, we continue to watch all geography's as covid-19 cases rise, particularly whether this impacts patient utilization and whether the V shaped recovery becomes more of a double. But at this stage, we do not see any reason why we should go into the recovery. Seems quite stable as dental practices are open. Before we move on to the performance of our medical business, let me comment on the recent announcement that Denault that the dental supply company, or TDE. Which was originally launched by the California Dental Association to offer members of organized dentistry a low price online only option for obtaining dental supplies has joined Henry Shine. TDC will maintain its core focus on providing consistent online only competitive pricing to dental association members, TDE customers will benefit from the expanded product portfolio, enhance shipping, improved order fulfillment and, of course, faster delivery. Backed by Henry Shine and Roshan's full service distribution model, coupled with TDE strategy, will offer State Dental Association members the options they seek when choosing to purchase dental supplies and small equipment for their practices. These two marketing channels are complementary and are aimed at delivering the requisite level of service for varying customer segments. Henry Shine will, of course, maintain and build on our full service distribution model, offering customers a wide range of competitively priced consumable merchandise, equipment and technology products and services, including software coupled with our highly experienced field and telesales teams, TDC has had sales in 2019 of approximately 20 million dollars.
[00:28:16] So a high touch. Model is very much the model that we subscribe to Ed Henry Shine, but we are offering an alternative of a pure online service to those customers that wish. To take advantage of such an offering. Now let's move to our medical business. The medical sales growth during the third quarter was also driven by strong demand from BP and covid-19 related products. This marked the first quarter in which our medical team achieved a billion dollars in sales. And we are extremely pleased with the medical teams track record in building this business. We are beginning to see improved access to cover test solutions that were first being allocated to the government for initial distribution. As we move into Twenty twenty one, we expect testing solution availability for practitioners to continue to improve as more tests are approved and as further allocation to the private sector markets occur in line with manufacturing capacity increases. We are, as noted, receiving greater allocation of tests for office based practitioners who very much view it as important to conduct specifically the rapid.
[00:29:35] covid tests in their offices. In other words, the point of care tests. EPS and covid-19 related product sales as a percentage of the global medical sales increased from mid single digit percentage three 19 covid-19 to approximately 17 percent in the second quarter and approximately 24 percent in the third quarter. We expect that people and covid related products sales, including tests, will continue to be a meaningful portion of our medical sales as practices seek to create a safe environment for both patients and staff and undertake more testing in the office based setting environment. Regarding the potential to distribute covid-19 vaccines, I'd like to point out that Henry Shion has had a long history of leadership and supply chain readiness in response. The strategic partnerships we have developed over many years provide us with the specialized insight into outbreaks and supply chain challenges. We also have excuse me, we also have excellent. Relationships with a number of manufacturers working on vaccines. And I'll stay in close contact with these manufacturers. We believe that when these products into the commercial distribution channel that we. Well, with our credibility and our history of effectively working with pharmaceutical manufacturers as well as a public private partnerships will be recognized as well as the office based.
[00:31:21] Practitioner will also be recognized as a place to administer these vaccines. So let's move on to our technology and value added services business. As dental practices continue to reopen throughout the third quarter, Henry shines one transaction software revenue, including claims of credit card processing, was down and it slightly is going up slightly.
[00:31:53] Really following the the trends of visits to dental practices. This was offset by solid growth and I was comparing it to the previous year to 2019. This is offset by solid growth in sales of our dental plans and 26 percent cloud based software solutions. Remote access provided through cloud based solutions such as Centrex and. Are especially attractive to practices that desire to have a requirement to conduct remote work, including managing the business and clinical aspects of their practice.
[00:32:36] During the third quarter, we launched a number of product enhancements for our generation, one solutions. Including a number of new DSR centric capabilities, imaging enhancements, new sophisticated accounting capabilities and prescribing solutions and payment processing features in the dental product. New insurance management and payment processing enhancements in districts and key enhancements to our very successful online bill payment solution. We continue. We continue to invest in our platform of dental software solutions to deliver integrated technologies that automates more tests and simplifies the digital workflow to increase practice productivity. In summary, looking at our current business, while it's still early in the fourth quarter, we are continuing to see dental and medical sales growth over the prior year at this time driven by EPS and other covid related products. That said, this is not necessarily indicative of what full. Quite a performance, may be, but having said that, we are very encouraged with the performance in October actually across the board, but of course must be a little cautious in that. This is a very unpredictable, unpredictable, unpredictable time. So before we move to your questions, I would like to note how pleased we were in September to be named to the Fortune magazine's Change the World List, which is an annual ranking of companies that have had a positive social impact through activities that are part of the core business strategy.
[00:34:25] And the shine was recognized for our role in helping to create the pandemic, changed its pandemic supply chain network at the World Economic Forum in 2015, a public private partnership aimed at saving lives by strengthening the resilience of global health care supply chain in general, in response to epidemics and pandemics, we are most pleased to serve as the EPS and private sector lead on these very important initiatives. We were also pleased to be named among the top Nasdaq listed companies, including the Next Generation 100 Index, designed to measure performance of the largest 100 non-financial Nasdaq companies that are focused on growth and innovation, which are ranked after those companies in the Nasdaq 100 index by capital, by market capitalization. This week is a special week, and Henry Shine with respect to Nasdaq as we celebrate, 25 years is a public company on the exchange. Over the of those years, we have successfully navigated through many changing market dynamics and grown our business. Delivering value to our shareholders. In fact, since the time of our IPO, we are pleased to have delivered compounded annual growth from continuing operations of 13 percent in sales and 14 percent in non-GAAP EPS through the end of 2019. So with those comments in mind, we'd be very pleased, Stephen.
[00:36:00] And I expect you to answer any questions that investors may have. Thank you.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[00:36:07] This time, if you'd like to ask a question, please, press star, followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. Our first question will come from the line of Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Nathan Rich
[00:36:19] Good morning and thanks for the questions, maybe starting with your comments on the Outlook standard. Could you give us any detail on how October performed relative to the third quarter? And when we think about your expectation for growth to moderate relative to the third quarter, is that solely due to what you're seeing with respect to PPC and covid related products? Or are you also expecting moderation in sort of the underlying growth rate for the dental and medical segments as well?
Stanley Bergman
[00:36:50] So thank you for the question. October has continued with the trend of September, in fact, even maybe a little higher. The concern we have is the potential impact of the rising number of diagnoses covid patients. Having said that, at the moment it seems like dental practices are seeing patients again, very different to April, both domestically and in most markets abroad, some markets at a much greater increased rate than even before Crovitz and others down. So we just want to be cautious in the context of the latest data on diagnose patients. Having said that, the business seems a pretty good place right now with Dennis across the board seeing patients. And the same for medical practitioners Stephen.
Steven Paladino
[00:37:51] Yeah, I think that summarizes it, you know, I would add maybe a couple of additional points, we think during Q3 there was a bit continued a bit of a backlog of patient demand that got caught up during Q3 that may not continue going forward.
[00:38:12] We also think related to PPTA and Copan related cells, that there was a lot of initial order taking, you know, to start up practices and to restart practices that may not continue at the same rate. So so those reasons really also contribute to us being a little bit more cautious on the outlook going forward.
Nathan Rich
[00:38:33] That's helpful and just two quick clarifications with respect to the rising covid case counts that you cited. Have you seen an impact in your volumes in recent weeks, or is that just kind of adding to the uncertainty in the outlook? And then secondly, Steve, could you maybe talk through your expectations on pricing going forward is just as we think about the magnitude of the top line and margin impact we should expect in the fourth quarter and beyond?
Stanley Bergman
[00:39:04] We don't see a significant change in volume at this moment. Practitioners seem to be seeing patients consistent with what we saw in September. Having said that, anecdotally, the ADA data is down a couple of percent. I'm not sure whether that is meaningful or not. Having said that, our caution relates to the increase in diagnosed patients both in the United States and in Europe. But at the same time, we don't see a significant reduction in visits to practitioners. Stephen?
Steven Paladino
[00:39:41] Yeah, and on PPE and related products, I think we would assume that pricing will continue to moderate, you know, back in Q2 and early to be the pricing for for certain products, primarily facemasks, was significantly elevated as there was a shortage of supply. And that was really our cost was really significantly higher than typical costs was. As you know, as supply continues to improve, that pricing is beginning to moderate on most of those products. There is one product category, though, that is now in short supply. So be hard to tell how this is impacted. But nitrile examination gloves are now in very short supply globally. So we may see a spike in in our cost for those products, which would in turn have us increase somewhat our pricing to end users. But I would say for the most part, I would think that pricing will moderate on on products that PPE and company related.
Nathan Rich
[00:40:56] That's helpful. Thanks for the question.
Operator
[00:40:59] Your next question will come from the line of Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Steven Valiquette
[00:41:05] Great, thanks. Good morning, Stan and Steve, thanks for taking the question. So getting a few questions here on the gross margins, it was fairly flat sequentially, but down year over year, likely just due to mix. I guess I'm curious if there's any color on how much the gross margin in 3Q was impacted just simply by greater mix of lower margin medical sales versus higher margins, dental sales.
Stanley Bergman
[00:41:29] And Steven.
Steven Paladino
[00:41:29] Steve, the main driver, was not mix, the main driver, as we outlined in our press release, was related to PPE and related product where, you know, because early on in and buying that product, we saw significant increases in our cost. And remember, it was a difficult time to even access products back then. Most suppliers were not selling unless you prepaid for the product and there was absolutely no way to negotiate pricing at that time. We made a decision that it's important to have access to product for our customers because it's such a critical product category. And because of that, we did buy some product at high prices that required inventory adjustments during the quarter. So that was one that was the biggest impact on margins for the quarter. There were also some other impacts. Some of the selling prices were also at lower margins. That was a smaller contributor and also supplier rebates, also a smaller contributor with less in the quarter because of volume that they related to. I'm hopeful that we'll see a lot of that go away, although it's really difficult to predict on inventory adjustments because the pricing is still very volatile on both the purchase side as well as the market sale side. So we'll just kind of have to wait and see for that.
Steven Valiquette
[00:43:02] Ok, I appreciate the color. Thanks.
Operator
[00:43:06] Your next question will come from the line of Jon Block with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Block
[00:43:11] Great, thanks and good morning, guys. Maybe just to start with you, if you can compare and contrast some of the dental consumable things that you gave, I think XP and covid dental consumables were flat at like the basic consumables. But I thought you mentioned a very strong dental specialty number that was up 14 percent North America. I think even implants up 18 percent. So maybe you can just talk to that dichotomy between the two within consumables. And then I've just got a follow up.
Stanley Bergman
[00:43:41] Yes, it's a very good question. So if you take out the PPE related sales, actually the product related sales, because within that category it's PPE and testing. But if you take that all out and you look at both dental and medical, our sales for core products, consumables is about flat. So. That's where we've been for the third quarter and it's looked like it looks like that's where we are in October as well. So. And that's the basic situation, patients really are visiting Dennis.
[00:44:32] Same with physicians, so we're quite comfortable that they will remain busy. But of course, there is no and there's no clarity as to what could happen in November and December, given the increase in diagnosis. Having said that, clearly practitioners are open to see patients. Everywhere other than really in the U.K., which is an anomaly, are very, very different to the situation in April and the early part of May. Did you have another question?
Jonathan Block
[00:45:12] Well, I do have another one. Thank you, Stephen. Are you on the gross margin? And it follows up on Steve's question, you know, twenty six and change down about 300 or so basis points. And you have been running steadily, pretty steadily, thirty to thirty one percent throughout twenty eighteen or nineteen, I guess sort of a two part question. Is there a gross margin to put on that PPE and covid bucket and or if not just looking forward, most importantly, do we think about gross margins improving off this, call it, you know, trough twenty six six, but maybe not recapturing the 30 to 31 percent longer term because you'll always have to a certain extent that lower margin PPE sales, somewhat permanent nature, the consumable sales. Thanks, guys.
Steven Paladino
[00:46:01] Yeah. Let me just touch on the earlier question. When Stanley commented that excluding PPA and covid products, consumable merchandise sales were relatively flat. That includes the positive benefit of specialty sales, John. So it's all embedded in that because that's included in consumables. So, Garchik, your current question, you know, it's still there's still a lot of volatility in margins related to PPA and Kovac related. And as I said, you know, natural gloves is the next one that will probably show a significant increase in costs for us. And there's a limit on what we could pass through. So I'm not ready to to give guidance on gross margin just yet because there's too much volatility on the buy side and on the south side. And it's all related, you know, PPY and covid products as positives and that it really drives sales growth. That really drives people buying additional products. If you don't have the product, you may lose the entire sale, but it also has huge volatility in margin. So you've got to take the positive with the not so positive.
Jonathan Block
[00:47:14] Understood. Thanks for the call.
Stanley Bergman
[00:47:15] John. Just ahead, a little bit more light on the specialty side, the specialty businesses, of course, a high margin business. But in terms of sales compared to the total approximately 10 billion dollar business, it's not material. But in terms of profits, it is very important. And that those businesses have done quite well, certainly in the third quarter and going into the fourth quarter. So in terms of materiality, in terms of the overall sales, it's not material in terms of profit, it's a decent contributor.
Jonathan Block
[00:47:53] Perfect. Thanks for the color.
Operator
[00:47:56] Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Baird. Please go ahead.
Jeffrey Johnson
[00:48:02] Thank you. Good afternoon or good morning, guys. Maybe just following up on both of John's questions, if I could. So, Steve, if Specialty was slightly pot or was positive in the quarter, as you mentioned, nicely positive in the quarter, you know, that would put general consumables on the dental side, maybe down low to mid single digits or so. Yet we know the ADA survey at that down 20 percent. That's kind of consistent with what our surveys have been showing as well, is that when you talk about kind of a little falloff from here is that we get a little bit of normalization from here between kind of where you have been at, maybe that down five percent for general consumables going somewhere between there and kind of where some of those volume surveys are showing.
Steven Paladino
[00:48:44] Well, let me Jeff, let me just clarify on the ADA survey that talking about patient traffic, that 80 percent, plus or minus is estimated patient traffic. You know, so we think actual sales volume is a bit better than that because it doesn't really factor in, you know, the additional sales of PPY products. It also seems that, you know, based on a procedure basis, for some reason, procedures are a little bit higher volume that are currently being done than historically. So. So the 80 is in sales volume is higher than 80 percent in sorry, the 80 percent patient traffic is higher in sales volume. And so hopefully that clarifies. And I just want to make sure you have a second question there, Jeff, if you could just repeat it.
Jeffrey Johnson
[00:49:39] No, it was just my question. If I understand the volume side and like I said, that's I know a lot of surveys are showing that down 20 and we are getting the higher intensity of dentistry and things like that to drive. The revenue was higher than that. But as you talk about kind of a little bit of a falloff in the dental performance going forward, is it because revenues start to normalize at least a little bit back towards volumes? You know, over time, I wouldn't think Mix can be such a positive contributor of 15 or so points as it's been here in the last quarter.
Stanley Bergman
[00:50:10] Yeah, I think that's correct. It's also, again, a few other things that, you know, moderating pricing on products that should continue if some of this pent up demand that may fall off a little bit. It's a little bit of increases in, you know, positive test results for covid. So I don't think it's one particular item. It's just a few things that are impacting our thoughts on that.
Jeffrey Johnson
[00:50:37] Fair enough, and then last question, just on the margin side, you know, John asked if we were at Tropp margin on the gross margin side, you know, you did talk about some of these temporary cost savings going away. And I think that's more on the OpEx side. But in the past, I think you've also talk about sourcing some PPE from local markets for local markets. So as we think about those two levers, you know, do we see margins staying down at these levels? Can they tick back up in the near term just over the next 12, 18 months? Is there a trend up or down from these levels on the margin side?
Stanley Bergman
[00:51:15] Yeah, I think there's too many too much volatility for us to really give specific guidance on this. You know, again, you know, we don't know exactly what's going to happen with natural clubs, but we do know that there's a worldwide shortage. And what that means to pricing and margin is still ahead of us. I don't want to, you know, just speculate on that. So I think we just really can't give specific guidance along those lines at this time. So hopefully we'll have better insight.
Jeffrey Johnson
[00:51:48] Understood. Thank you.
Stanley Bergman
[00:51:49] OK.
Operator
[00:51:51] Your next question comes from the line of Steve Bushar with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Steve Beuchaw
[00:51:58] Hi, thanks for the time here. So there's been a lot of questions asked about a lot of, you know, very important parts of the progression and the model. But what I think we might benefit from is even even if it's philosophical. But as you think about getting into planning for 2014 and beyond, when you try to piece together all the parts, even if we just isolate and say, hey, let's just talk about the top line, when you've got a base business, you know, excluding combat related items that that's flat in the middle of a pandemic and then you have probably an elevated PSA tailwind for some. What would it take to get, you know, 21 revenues to be lower than 2019? Is there a way we can sort of set a floor here?
Stanley Bergman
[00:52:46] We remain quite optimistic in the return of the business, specifically in dentistry, given the fact that the strength in business, the dentists starting in June, we were quite surprised at how fast the recovery occurred and we remain optimistic that that will continue to increase. People want to see dentists and there's a huge trust that dental offices are safe. So we can't say for sure how many quarters the covered high test data will continue. But as the data comes down, I think you can expect for dentists offices to fill up to the rate of. Twenty nineteen, I think they are dealing with the inefficiency in the office because of a scepters control, they're getting much better at that. But as we get into, say, the middle of Twenty twenty one. I think we can expect to go back to normalcy of where it was in 2009 until all depends, of course, on when the vaccine will be available and how effective it will be. But it seems like the seventy five to seven to 80 percent number is a number that looks good for this time. And from there, I think we'll build up based on the effectiveness of the vaccine and actually more testing availability. We have seen that in markets where there is comfort and returned to normal rates such as China. Australia, New Zealand people are very comfortable going to the dentist and our specialty businesses, for example, and those markets is doing extremely well, so we are enthusiastic that we will return to more normal rates sometime in the middle of next year, assuming that the vaccine kicks in and is relatively efficient. But it seems that we've get more or less the floor. But again, it's very hard to give you a precise timing on all of that.
Steve Beuchaw
[00:55:13] Ok, that that's fair. Two very quick follow ups, one for Stan, one for Steve Stanley. I wonder if you could spend just a minute on the TDC transaction. I realize it's not a huge business that you're acquiring here, but it might be a pretty significant segment of the market that you can go after a little bit more acutely. Could you just talk about the definition of that customer segment of the market that you're going after a little bit more, you know, perhaps more effectively with diciest part of the portfolio here? And then, Steve, I wonder if you could spend a minute on what I've been calling cost savings discovery. So, you know, covid has given us a window into, you know, where we might have been spending money here and there. And we've obviously had to stop spending money on certain things like travel. How is that progression going? How close are you to maybe, you know, putting a dollar amount or basis points on what might be a permanent cost savings from that discovery effort? Thank you.
Stanley Bergman
[00:56:19] Very good question. Again, on the TSC, we. See that there's always been a market. So let's put it this way, non full-service, non high touch, that was the marketing machine was in a couple of decades ago and the percentage of business being transacted through what was originally mail order that went to telesales and now now is defined as e-commerce has been relatively constant. Up to the end of 2019, during the covid period, it increased just like all e-commerce increased both the e-commerce only businesses, the online only businesses and our own website where the volumes of business that were transacted digitally increased. We've always had a strong relationship with organized dentistry, and there is a part of the market that would like to transact business digitally only online only. And so we made an investment alongside the California Dental Association. To. Into the online only marketplace, we are through other investments in the United States and particularly abroad, invested in alternate channels. And although these channels have not exhibited significantly faster growth rates than the full service part until the end of 2019, we think that it is important for us to service this part of the market and to provide both options to Dennis in the United States, as, by the way, we do in Europe and elsewhere. So we will keep the two models side by side and will service both from the same distribution network.
Steven Paladino
[00:58:22] So on cost saving items, Steve, so there's two primary areas that we're still evaluating and focusing on, and we think we will be able to save expenses on the first travel, but it's really broader than just travel. It also includes things like conventions, even investor meetings. Not sure. I think everyone knows on this call that this now virtual investor meetings and conferences, similarly with conventions, is more virtual items. So we certainly believe there's opportunity there for travel to to significantly reduce travel. Things like video conferencing certainly work. I think the people who are a little bit skeptical previous to this, I think realize that while it's not as good as in person, it's really good and in many cases cancel flights. So that's one area that we're still evaluating. And the second area is we do believe that there's a fair amount of our timesharing members who can work from home either permanently or on a hybrid basis. And we're doing a person by person detailed review to determine what that opportunity is. But certainly we do think that that opportunity over the longer term will be a benefit for us. But just recognize on on that, you know, the real estate footprint, it will take a little bit longer, you know, to reduce the real estate footprint or whatever that those lower needs will be. But both of those are still under evaluation. We don't have final answers on either one, but we certainly believe that they will they will drive some costs, some permanent cost savings going forward. We have not yet quantified the specific amount.
Steve Beuchaw
[01:00:15] Ok, thank you for all the help.
Operator
[01:00:19] Our final question will come from the line of Glen Sant'Angelo with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.
Glen Santangelo
[01:00:24] Oh, yeah, thanks for taking my question. Stan, I just want to follow up from something we talked about last quarter around the vaccine opportunity. I think, you know, 90 days ago, you thought it was a little bit too early to speculate on if there would be a potential role for Henry Shine and what they could maybe look like. Have you given any more thought to that? Is it closer to hopefully the launch of a successful vaccine here? And maybe what what will Henry Chan could play given where you sit in the supply channel?
Stanley Bergman
[01:00:53] Esslin, I think that. There will be a role for Henry Shine once the vaccine is outside of government distribution since it is expected. It's our view that vaccines will at some point be administered in physician offices and in the workplace. We have a very nice workplace health care business. And so once we're through the initial. Government period of distribution of these vaccines using a third party logistics provider and when these vaccines return, will become available through normal commercial operations. We expect that we will have a role to play as we have in administering vaccines in general. And we've had that role for decades. Likewise with testing, we think that as the government takes less of the tests and allows the private sector to manage testing to a greater extent, that IndusInd will receive a greater allocation of tests as well. I could jump.
Glen Santangelo
[01:02:05] Maybe just one more, you know, stepping back from all the near-term questions around you. I was just kind of curious about the performance of the CEOs in the current environment is maybe very different than independent practices. And, you know, in this environment, you know, any longer term impact the customer makes going forward, any discernible trends you're seeing between the two different classes?
Stanley Bergman
[01:02:31] I think basically we're on the same trajectory the last year, sows growing to the extent that can secure General Dennis, the midsized practitioners perhaps growing to a greater extent. But this is a very solid base of private practitioners. I doubt the one or two practice will survive long, but three or four or five practitioners going to maybe 10 in the practice has, in my view, quite a lot of runway. So I don't think there's any marked difference in where dental dentistry will be practiced. But the trend that we've seen over the years is likely to continue and as it has moderately and the movement upstream will continue in a moderate way to grow in a moderate way. So I'm, uh, I don't see any significant dislocation of where the industry will take place, although the trend will continue upstream.
Glen Santangelo
[01:03:36] Ok, thank you.
Operator
[01:03:40] I'll now turn the conference back over for any closing comments.
Stanley Bergman
[01:03:44] Thank you very much, operator. We do feel very comfortable, everyone, with our strategy. We are comfortable that we will continue to. Serve the dental needs across the globe. And we are comfortable through our hybrid full service model and in certain markets, digital only model, that this will be a very good strategy going forward as we provide more value added services to our customers, helping them operate more efficient practice so that they can provide better clinical care. We believe that infection control is important in both the dental offices and medical offices and that. We can provide the necessary PPE that is needed and that testing will become more important in our physician offices going forward. We also believe that our equipment, businesses and dental are on solid footing. It may be a slight. But going back perhaps in the US dental market, as the disease will numbers compared to the previous year, as we had a very strong. Fourth quarter foods will last year, but overall, we're comfortable that identity equipment business in the United States and in Europe is on a solid footing with decent backlogs throughout so as well. Just to comment with any questions on this, but we believe in the second one is providing great value, moving towards more of cloud based software and are very comfortable and excited with that business opportunity. So let me end today where I started and once again extend thanks to team members across the globe for the unrelenting efforts on behalf of our customers. The team's passion. Commitment to his mission has been nothing short of remarkable. As it relates to our business, we believe we are well positioned, as I noted, due to our breadth of products, services and support with solid momentum to build shareholder value as we emerge from the covid-19 pandemic. Again, it is clear that there is a demand for dentistry and for the physician based practice as procedures move from the acute care setting to more of the ultimate setting. And we remain quite optimistic about the future of Henry Shine. So thank you for joining us today and look forward to speaking to you on our next call. Thank you,
[01:06:38] Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude your call for today. Thank you all for participating. And you may now disconnect.
