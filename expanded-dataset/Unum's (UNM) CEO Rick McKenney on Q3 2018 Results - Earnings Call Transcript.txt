Thank you Tom and good morning everyone. The third quarter of 2018 was both a strong and pivotal quarter for the company. Earlier in the quarter we released the results of our long-term care review, which have now been incorporated in our financial results. 
More importantly, our core businesses continue to deliver strong premium growth and strong margins. In our market of employee benefits, the operating environment remains very good for us as the economy continues to perform well. A tighter labor market means full employment and wage inflation, both of which continue to provide more potential customers and increase the need for the financial protections that we provide. A stronger economy may also see higher interest rates, which is a real plus for our business. Overall, it was a good quarter and we are building momentum moving forward.
As I mentioned in the third quarter results we reported yesterday afternoon, included the impact of the reserve addition to our long-term care business that we pre-announced back in mid-September. There were no material changes from that review. Adjusting for that, as well as for net realized investment gain in the quarter, our adjusted after tax operating earnings were just over $300 million, an increase of 22% over the year ago quarter. Adjusted operating earnings per share were a $1.37 in the third quarter, an increase of just under 26%, compared to the third quarter of last year’s $1.09.
Well, we will continue to address the long-term care block and update you on its trends as they evolve over time. We are very focused on the positive, underlying trends we are seeing in our core business operations and the consistent financial results they're generating. Here are a few points I'd like to highlight on the performance this quarter. First, premium growth for our core business segments remains favorable, increasing 6% this quarter on a year-over-year basis. This growth is being generated by a number of encouraging trends, including strong persistency, in our Unum US business, excellent sales momentum in Colonial Life, and disciplined management of rate increases on in-force business in Unum UK.
Next, we continue to see generally consistent benefits experience across the core business segments, particularly in our Unum US and Colonial Life business lines. Benefits experienced at our UK business has been more volatile recently, but our disciplined approach to underwriting and pricing in our key U.S. and UK business segments continue to generate consistent results.
We also continue to see stable to improving expense ratios for the business segments through the active management of expenses and the benefits of investments that we have made. And continue to make – to improve the customer experience.
With these strong operating trends, we continue to see excellent profit margins and returns for our core segments, which in turn drive significant financial flexibility for the company. This financial flexibility allows us to invest in the growth of our business, both organically and through the expansion of our footprint, such as with Pramerica
