# Modality
This archive hosts the data and code base of our paper *Predicting Modality in Financial Dialogue*.

The file `data.csv` contains the 5K instances comprising our new modality dataset.

`lda_5.pkl` is the pickled topic model.

The files `classify_earlyfuse.py` and `classify_latefuse.py` contain the code for running the binary modality classifier with early- and late-fused features, respectively.
