Okay Also on the value toothpaste we are hearing from P&G that they believe they are becoming a category leader overall in oral care and that as such there will be less and less space for minor brands some of which are in your portfolio Is it possible that you would just discontinue some of the smaller brands that have been under pressure for so much time,3,67,1,0.0,0.014925373134328358,0.029850746268656716,0.0,0.014925373134328358,1.010060424,14.95,8125.8993599999985,8,1.036517038,2.59808,2006-Aug-01,XEL

And given that what are the prospects to try to begin to build something like the work number in other countries It seems like it has been such a home run that I realize it probably would take {DATE} But is that something that is on your radar,3,48,1,0.0,0.0,0.041666666666666664,0.0,0.0,1.349759301,15.2,39094.93312,9,0.31461308600000004,0.8723,2006-Aug-10,TGT
Okay Secondly if you just looked at fasten exclusive of the graphics and reflective business was the operating income sort of up or down or flat {DATE},2,27,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037037037037037035,0.0,1.349759301,15.2,39094.93312,9,0.31461308600000004,0.8723,2006-Aug-10,TGT

I would assume a review of the dividend is not for a lower dividend but a higher dividend,1,18,1,0.0,0.0,0.05555555555555555,0.0,0.0,2.342797786,12.99,23121.34878,9,0.201206563,1.57266,2006-Sep-12,BBY
So just kind of getting into {DATE} of gas leasing and then looking forward as you make capital allocation decisions we should think that the majority of your leasing willing be oil directed,1,33,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.539050478,11.98,4273.063560000001,9,0.291033765,2.8005,2006-Sep-20,KMX
I guess but would it be fair to say that spending against core brands would be up,1,17,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058823529411764705,1.784280233,11.62,14773.46325,9,0.111182385,6.0465,2006-Oct-12,YUM

Okay And then secondly I think Ken I think in a speech {DATE} you made the comment that you thought and sorry if I get to wrong nonperformers actually peak in {DATE} Is that correct and do you still feel that way,3,42,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.023809523809523808,1.773363066,11.09,124430.38,6,0.249664542,3.65051,2006-Oct-17,INTC
The way you characterized it it sounds like it is primarily fuel that is causing the gross margin pressure in {DATE} And that it is not yet a big impact from tighter capacity Is that right,3,36,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.639109401,11.73,9907.0125,6,0.208317064,0.1696,2006-Oct-18,LLTC

Thand you Just a quick question the change to the sign up process again Would you guys consider that what you 're doing now is more conservative than what your peers are doing in terms of walking customers through the or taking them deeper into the sign up process,3,49,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02040816326530612,2.8936115210000004,11.73,6365.77408,6,0.237188092,1.20257,2006-Oct-18,CTXS
You feel you can operate pretty well in this environment and still be able to source quality deals,1,18,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05555555555555555,0.0,1.5975532140000002,11.73,31197.652,10,0.12528151199999998,3.18397,2006-Oct-18,GILD
Okay So you will not say that the guns are now working,2,12,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.5975532140000002,11.73,31197.652,10,0.12528151199999998,3.18397,2006-Oct-18,GILD
Got it How do you think about your outerwear assortment just {DATE} versus {DATE} overall,2,15,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.236158907,11.34,8005.75535,6,0.323400257,3.84854,2006-Oct-19,XLNX
Was the prior thought on SG&A leverage in {DATE} was a range of {PERCENT} an now you 're tightening it to {PERCENT},1,22,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045454545454545456,2.2500149940000003,11.34,5078.9580700000015,6,0.379914035,0.5102,2006-Oct-19,VRSN
Okay but if I read you right you can go deeper later on if you need to,1,17,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.2500149940000003,11.34,5078.9580700000015,6,0.379914035,0.5102,2006-Oct-19,VRSN
A couple follow ups to prior questions You described your thoughts about margins over {DATE} Can you push it out to {DATE} What happens afterwards Do you think costs measurements I mean I understand just from what you 've said the activity levels are a little bit unclear but are you still thinking international margins come down by some multiple {CARDINAL} basis points,7,63,1,0.0,0.0,0.015873015873015872,0.0,0.015873015873015872,2.2500149940000003,11.34,5078.9580700000015,6,0.379914035,0.5102,2006-Oct-19,VRSN
Going to the gross margin question do you think {DATE} was the peak gross margin or you could possibly see better margins sometime during this calendar {DATE},1,27,1,0.0,0.07407407407407407,0.1111111111111111,0.037037037037037035,0.037037037037037035,1.156413608,11.34,50515.47787,9,0.378512986,0.2582,2006-Oct-19,MCD
How do you think about the spread between the costs of those capital over time in the context of {DATE} 's environment,1,22,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.373719692,10.9,96815.93472,10,0.276433203,0.29241,2006-Oct-20,MRK
Would you say it 's the majority of your shipments now,1,11,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.549803649,10.63,1515.74496,12,0.152697845,3.73836,2006-Oct-23,NFLX
Okay that is helpful And are you what are you doing to prepare for that Are there other shipping lines that you do n't already partner with that you trying to forge a relationship with and how is that going,3,40,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.549803649,10.63,1515.74496,12,0.152697845,3.73836,2006-Oct-23,NFLX
Okay And then there would also be a drag embedded in that from currency,2,14,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07142857142857142,3.549803649,10.63,1515.74496,12,0.152697845,3.73836,2006-Oct-23,NFLX
Okay got you And then just kind of working through the gross margin sounds like that was more moderated Is that simply all foreign currency or is that any other thing impacting your expectations on the gross margin line,3,39,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.653945183,10.66,6800.64348,6,0.224501386,0.54222,2006-Oct-26,MCHP
Okay so ex that what would it have been,1,9,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.658280796,10.78,19569.79332,6,0.808445629,0.86595,2006-Oct-25,SYMC
Did any of the people you were talking to try to make an offer or you just did n't go tell them no,1,23,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.658280796,10.78,19569.79332,6,0.808445629,0.86595,2006-Oct-25,SYMC
Claiborne you indicated that Samarai was {CARDINAL} interest and was n't originally that unit you and Anadarko in the lease,1,20,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8854117229999999,10.66,8910.97565,8,1.036517038,2.79697,2006-Oct-26,XEL
And obviously relatively small number and right now it 's all healthcare related and it 's all debt and you 're just doing it opportunistically,3,25,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04,0.8854117229999999,10.66,8910.97565,8,1.036517038,2.79697,2006-Oct-26,XEL
Okay and that that impacted directly your operating profit right,1,10,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8854117229999999,10.66,8910.97565,8,1.036517038,2.79697,2006-Oct-26,XEL
So should we assume that your internal goal would be to grow sales faster than inventory,1,16,1,0.0,0.0,0.0625,0.0,0.0,1.142729962,10.66,422151.3966,4,0.383360232,2.6882900000000003,2006-Oct-26,XOM
Fantastic Now on the product pricing side of things assuming let 's say that crude oil and natural gas prices remain where they are {DATE} there 's a lot of chatter about Asian crackers really sort of making breakeven to negative profitability So if energy prices remain where they are {DATE} do you see over {DATE} a positive inflection call it in spot pricing on the olefin side of things,3,70,1,0.0,0.0,0.014285714285714285,0.04285714285714286,0.014285714285714285,0.836344933,10.8,112586.4013,7,0.745982293,1.14226,2006-Oct-30,VZ
So you guys booked actually a pretty small gain in your private equity holdings which seemed kind of conservative given the pretty significant price rise we saw in equity markets Could you comment maybe about that and is that just a conservative market we should assume,2,46,1,0.0,0.043478260869565216,0.06521739130434782,0.021739130434782608,0.0,0.832990155,11.09,15050.37384,8,0.817120588,7.756689999999999,2006-Nov-08,PCG
Just curious in terms of how you 're thinking and this may be an Allen question how you 're thinking about the capital expansion process I know it 's in the budget for ATC but in terms of the execution part of that meaning getting permits getting siting getting it done on time on trajectory,3,55,1,0.0,0.01818181818181818,0.01818181818181818,0.0,0.01818181818181818,1.723523612,10.5,14128.145,6,0.137998211,4.51371,2006-Nov-15,NTAP
Thank you I apologize I have been jumping back and forth across a couple of calls Steve so if you addressed this I apologize It 's been my perception that the environment over {DATE} has given you guys perhaps a little more visibility than normal I 'm curious notwithstanding the seasonal issues in {DATE} as you think about lead times and just the rate at which customers are placing orders how would you characterize visibility {DATE} and I guess as you answer the question Steve you always had a better view than most on the economy and the macro As you think about {DATE} is the macro a tailwind a headwind or a neutral factor as we think about your growth,7,121,1,0.008264462809917356,0.008264462809917356,0.008264462809917356,0.008264462809917356,0.008264462809917356,1.38176333,10.31,11986.34499,6,0.16359135800000002,0.74162,2006-Nov-16,INTU
The reason I ask the question the way I did your efficiency ratio was {PERCENT} in {DATE} {PERCENT} in {DATE} and your guidance which certainly is appreciated is for {PERCENT} So you 're kind of already there So on a headline basis it might be tough for us to figure out some of the ins and outs or can you break it out or,4,64,1,0.0,0.015625,0.015625,0.015625,0.03125,1.943675568,10.05,12338.33768,9,0.18608913,0.58186,2006-Nov-20,JWN
Okay great My follow up just a clarification When we heard you last on the Olin announcement for the Chlor Alkali spin I think you mentioned that it would be accretive to EPS by about a nickel Just clarifying is that inclusive of the ethylene deal that you signed with them and the moratorium on share buybacks for the rest of {DATE},4,62,1,0.0,0.0,0.016129032258064516,0.016129032258064516,0.016129032258064516,1.314116929,11.23,16020.10025,9,0.393364003,2.99722,2006-Dec-05,KR
Okay And then finally on the revised EPS guidance Rob are you still assuming at the mid point that we have {CARDINAL} fed fund cuts that drive yield curve steepening or have you reevaluated that assumption as well,2,38,1,0.0,0.0,0.07894736842105263,0.0,0.0,1.3531003659999998,11.23,8162.168879999998,9,0.073149962,1.04445,2006-Dec-05,AZO

Okay Let me just ask my follow up point or question sorry On the last {DATE} conference call or I guess it was {DATE} conference call the target for cash flow from operations was {MONEY} I think Ursula said on the prepared remarks it was greater than {MONEY} I just wanted to confirm what are the cash flow targets for {DATE},5,61,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01639344262295082,0.01639344262295082,1.427289756,13.08,17880.72984,8,0.574054587,1.38664,2007-May-03,WMB
Right And if you look at the other acquisitions you 've done quite a lot lately Is it fair to say they 're on an aggregate basis accretive or are they still ramping up,3,34,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.745475879,13.5,13525.36075,9,0.15127555199999998,1.83711,2007-May-17,JWN
Good {TIME} I have a relatively simple question I think Setting aside sales comps would you prefer to have a dollar of sales {DATE} or {DATE},3,26,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.038461538461538464,0.038461538461538464,1.65439529,13.5,9377.844,6,0.16359135800000002,2.95329,2007-May-17,INTU
Should I say the whole thing again,1,7,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.65439529,13.5,9377.844,6,0.16359135800000002,2.95329,2007-May-17,INTU
And was the acuity of the surgeries was it higher than you 've seen recently or it was a lower acuity surgeries,1,22,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.40528883,13.5,10126.56,6,0.1103557,0.3581,2007-May-17,ADSK
Okay Do you see any opportunity to expand your position there or is that something you 're interested,2,18,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05555555555555555,0.0,1.26715325,13.3,18359.82575,9,0.272135775,0.40529,2007-May-22,SPLS
Okay So {CARDINAL} other follow up question real quickly and that is I 've noticed in your in the men 's areas some of the stores in my region are now showing men 's runway departments Is that something new Is that something you 're going to expand And how many of them are there currently,5,56,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.017857142857142856,1.26715325,13.3,18359.82575,9,0.272135775,0.40529,2007-May-22,SPLS
Okay And you should be gaining share over and above that I guess,3,13,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07692307692307693,0.0,1.277326924,13.06,49642.83084,9,0.307266258,3.85691,2007-May-23,TGT
Okay And then my second question is a lot of talk on the World Cup and the product offering I just wondered if any of you guys would share your predictions for the winner,3,34,1,0.0,0.0,0.029411764705882353,0.029411764705882353,0.029411764705882353,1.467296371,13.53,5650.99568,1,0.254690432,2.31176,2007-May-30,RL
Okay So I guess prior to {DATE} should we expect a slow decline How should we think about it between now and then,3,23,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08695652173913043,1.467296371,13.53,5650.99568,1,0.254690432,2.31176,2007-May-30,RL
Great From your slide {CARDINAL} where you talk you kind of walked through the cash flow there Maintenance capital {DATE} was {MONEY} maintenance capital {DATE} {MONEY} When you talk about maintenance capital I would 've thought there is n't that much variation from {DATE} How should we think about a normalized maintenance cap level for you guys,5,57,1,0.0,0.0,0.017543859649122806,0.017543859649122806,0.0,1.467296371,13.53,5650.99568,1,0.254690432,2.31176,2007-May-30,RL
I do n't want you to preannounce it but are we likely to have announcements,1,15,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.276784113,16.65,21065.06588,9,0.312777039,1.0982,2007-Jun-26,KR
{CARDINAL} final one for Clarence I know that J.B. Hunt who some might say would be the leader in intermodal in the U.S. currently have been deriving a lot of its growth in the east in lanes that heretofore were thought to be too short to support quality competitive intermodal operations But that 's where their focus is and I know that they have been chatting with you a little bit at least Any thought about whether there might be an opportunity to capture some of that business perhaps into the New England area or Florida or other areas where you might have an advantage over brand X,5,108,1,0.0,0.037037037037037035,0.037037037037037035,0.018518518518518517,0.0,1.915398261,18.89,4512.6848,6,0.189643262,2.34091,2007-Jun-27,RHT
Is it an active process underway at this point Jeff,1,10,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.137300122,15.53,15373.93473,12,0.127069607,0.10039,2007-Jun-28,PAYX
And then the follow up on that Dave these are times that we have n't seen in quite a while in terms of either market I mean good market volatility,3,30,1,0.0,0.0,0.03333333333333333,0.03333333333333333,0.03333333333333333,1.360338572,16.64,18024.09564,9,0.097163394,2.8987,2007-Jul-12,YUM
All right And could you give us some sense of how much Trojan might have been up at retail,2,19,1,0.0,0.10526315789473684,0.10526315789473684,0.0,0.0,0.7992120079999999,15.59,184800.4004,10,0.21274686,2.20478,2007-Jul-17,JNJ
Okay Were there any company or more likely customer specific issues in {DATE} here where maybe a ramp up did n't happen as fast or someone decreased spending where that impacted the overall rate,2,34,1,0.0,0.029411764705882353,0.029411764705882353,0.0,0.0,1.199999908,16.0,27539.19828,10,0.192140625,0.28865,2007-Jul-19,SYK
So but I mean is it fair to assume that you 're going to have a pretty significant margin decline {DATE} because you really have n't had enough time to do as much as you 'd like on some of the variable or semi variable costs Is that a fair way to look at it do you think,2,58,1,0.0,0.0,0.05172413793103448,0.0,0.017241379310344827,1.617958656,16.0,5604.19078,10,0.165776988,4.5056400000000005,2007-Jul-19,ISRG
Great And my final question on Commercial Real Estate on prepayment penalties for the new deals that you 're writing are you able to secure more stringent prepayments or is that an area where you 're getting a lot of pushback,2,41,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04878048780487805,0.07317073170731707,1.617958656,16.0,5604.19078,10,0.165776988,4.5056400000000005,2007-Jul-19,ISRG
Got you Okay And a CapEx number for {DATE} Steve,3,10,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.617958656,16.0,5604.19078,10,0.165776988,4.5056400000000005,2007-Jul-19,ISRG
So there 's some seasonality there,1,6,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.587942265,16.0,3643.99294,11,0.454893763,1.06895,2007-Jul-19,NDAQ
Okay And what is the expected ramp rate on that Is that something that as we get into {DATE} and anniversary its acquisition it should be running fairly efficiently Or will that always be just running at a lower,4,39,1,0.02564102564102564,0.0,0.0,0.02564102564102564,0.0,1.587942265,16.0,3643.99294,11,0.454893763,1.06895,2007-Jul-19,NDAQ
So at least in the near term then it does n't change at all any of the kind of timing of the way you would invest your capital or the scale of an ATM program or anything like that,1,39,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0995743059999998,16.0,8837.88189,9,0.183600269,6.0992,2007-Jul-19,SHW
What did retention actually end up at,1,7,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.294462747,16.0,36411.88446,10,0.060643773,2.68328,2007-Jul-19,GILD
Okay so it 's more on the expense side So you clearly should have some visibility toward that,2,18,1,0.05555555555555555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.932766993,16.0,22391.09509,11,0.493757161,0.03774,2007-Jul-19,BBT
Okay thanks And then just the follow up on the timing of the Atlanta sale Is that and the proceeds we should assume that those should be directly applied to a buyback upon closing,3,34,1,0.0,0.0,0.029411764705882353,0.0,0.029411764705882353,0.932766993,16.0,22391.09509,11,0.493757161,0.03774,2007-Jul-19,BBT
Okay and then the last question If you look at both of these should we view them between pooled health and aerial imagery as long term revenue objectives or are we going to see some waterfall sooner potentially {DATE},2,39,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02564102564102564,0.932766993,16.0,22391.09509,11,0.493757161,0.03774,2007-Jul-19,BBT
Okay All right And then lastly It would be helpful can you just tell us other in your breakout segment US versus Europe versus rest of world which of those regions you think will some be more impacted than others from the supply disruption How should we think about growth in each of those for the remainder of {DATE} Just qualitatively which do you think would be impacted more than the others,6,72,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.013888888888888888,1.291459262,15.23,22500.11366,10,0.71371904,0.7277100000000001,2007-Jul-20,BSX
And any particular segment commentary related to that,1,8,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.291459262,15.23,22500.11366,10,0.71371904,0.7277100000000001,2007-Jul-20,BSX
And then last one as we think about some of the gives and takes around procedures understand obviously you did n't change guidance on procedures {DATE} But do you see a path north of {PERCENT} in the medium to intermediate term {DATE} given everything you 've got in terms of new procedures I do n't want to box you into giving longer term guidance but how do you think about where procedures could go,3,74,1,0.0,0.013513513513513514,0.013513513513513514,0.0,0.0,2.8408642210000004,16.95,1327.73394,12,0.233449546,9.12422,2007-Jul-23,NFLX
Okay but I mean but for {DATE} was there an EPS impact,1,12,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.8408642210000004,16.95,1327.73394,12,0.233449546,9.12422,2007-Jul-23,NFLX
Would it take some sort of a drop off in load factors And how much before you might see some difference in fares,2,23,1,0.0,0.043478260869565216,0.043478260869565216,0.0,0.0,0.94840809,16.81,6447.186,12,0.179524455,1.4792,2007-Jul-24,EFX
Thank you I have a couple of questions Rick first just to follow up on your {DATE} comments you talked about growth but I did n't hear you mention the {PERCENT} EPS growth Is that what you 're thinking for {DATE} at this point Or are you trying to signal something else,6,52,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.019230769230769232,0.94840809,16.81,6447.186,12,0.179524455,1.4792,2007-Jul-24,EFX
Okay and that does n't include that 's just product only no service,2,13,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.381522566,16.81,15763.9485,10,0.468501743,5.16851,2007-Jul-24,BIIB
It is great Thanks Just to clarify was there ever a point in {DATE} where you had to rely more on synthetics or have you always been cash,3,28,1,0.03571428571428571,0.0,0.0,0.03571428571428571,0.0,1.381522566,16.81,15763.9485,10,0.468501743,5.16851,2007-Jul-24,BIIB
So the tax item is a bigger impact than the trading profit,1,12,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.694538307,16.81,3839.91376,10,0.10720216,3.3080199999999995,2007-Jul-24,VRTX
Would you suggest though that margins overall for Geco were up as multiclient starts to come back,1,17,1,0.0,0.058823529411764705,0.058823529411764705,0.0,0.0,0.816709923,16.81,30779.85484,3,0.209590277,1.16071,2007-Jul-24,KMB
Over {CARDINAL} And the {CARDINAL} over {MONEY} is that the most,2,11,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.4177545580000002,16.81,12991.8582,11,0.554014341,3.88956,2007-Jul-24,LM
Clarence do you have a sense of distribution across {DATE} for that I mean is it going to be a first {CARDINAL} weighted {CARDINAL} or should we expect I mean kind of {CARDINAL} to million {DATE} and kind of evenly throughout,3,41,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.23273294,18.55,3950.3584,9,0.383913085,1.94696,2007-Jul-25,ORLY
Okay but nothing there is nothing actively being discussed in the near term,1,13,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.420188782,18.55,72125.95764,6,0.22324655,2.8959,2007-Jul-25,QCOM
Great and you have a long term model of what you expect as a percentage of revenue or is it just expected to continue to take market share,1,28,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03571428571428571,0.0,1.344804633,18.55,8264.17215,8,0.872527733,1.19548,2007-Jul-25,XEL
Okay thank you And then as a follow up just in Europe I mean in the US I appreciate that PACCAR both Kenworth and Peterbilt are pretty strong in the oil and gas sectors In Europe the share gain by DAF is that more because the geographies that DAF is leveraged to are stronger or are there specific segments where DAF is particularly valued,4,64,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046875,0.0,1.5478883209999998,18.55,41191.34391,3,0.247462958,2.01148,2007-Jul-25,GLW
Okay John thank you {DATE} when Spirit maybe {DATE} or so when Spirit announced they were charging for carry ons congress summoned a number of airlines CEOs to basically promise congress that they would never do the same thing Jeff you were running Continental at the time You were conspicuously absent Was that a scheduling conflict or is there any particular reason why you did n't show up for that hearing,5,71,1,0.014084507042253521,0.014084507042253521,0.014084507042253521,0.0,0.028169014084507043,2.781174468,18.55,7641.963476999998,6,0.112117875,0.09796,2007-Jul-25,AKAM
So weather aside if I just assume normal weather I should be towards the top end,1,16,1,0.0,0.0,0.0625,0.0,0.0,1.91402971,18.55,117241.1666,6,0.15743153,5.65803,2007-Jul-25,AAPL
{DATE} Can we just talk about the remodels for a minute As you think about the remodeled stores that were offline in {DATE} I 'm guessing there will be significantly fewer closed in {DATE} so you have the fleet open for the holidays Is that a fair assumption,4,48,1,0.0,0.0,0.020833333333333332,0.0,0.020833333333333332,1.91402971,18.55,117241.1666,6,0.15743153,5.65803,2007-Jul-25,AAPL
Good {TIME} guys Say I was trying to look at just on the basis differential obviously continue very positive for you all Just looking at the recent slide you all talk about the price uplift either for Steve or one of you all just wondering about if you still have the same type of uplift for is it still {PERCENT} of the acreage in the wet is still considered wet Steve And then secondly I think on the slide it shows the uplift going from when it 's not processed around {CARDINAL} Is that uplift that percentage still in line or is it even going to be higher than that,5,110,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01818181818181818,0.0,1.3430633980000002,18.55,9128.0625,6,0.289649537,2.58015,2007-Jul-25,FISV
Okay So a portion of that the step up {CARDINAL} is ongoing and a portion of that profitability relates to market conditions for both product and other feedstocks I guess I 'm trying to distill which would ultimately at least how we model it drive a higher capture rate going forward So I 'm trying to find what that step change was given the Hess assets within your portfolio And I guess we could maybe use the volume metric time the margin that you provided,5,85,1,0.0,0.023529411764705882,0.023529411764705882,0.011764705882352941,0.0,0.813080013,18.1,18569.9388,10,0.229410717,3.43247,2007-Jul-26,BDX
Okay Let me ask one final question I want to make sure I understand your commentary on the cadence gross margin going forward because it has been a sticking point {DATE} was above expectations But you are guiding to {CARDINAL} basis points or so sequential decline in {DATE} I understand some of that should happen because of geography and Depakote IR and and then a big step up again in {DATE} Help me understand the mix cadence and anything else that might going on there that causes gross margins to go down by as much as you are expecting to {CARDINAL} and then the big step up in,6,108,1,0.0,0.009259259259259259,0.009259259259259259,0.0,0.018518518518518517,0.813080013,18.1,18569.9388,10,0.229410717,3.43247,2007-Jul-26,BDX
And then the question for Sanjay Sanjay you indicated that you 're obviously spending more on R&D now than really at any time in the past And I 'm just wondering with the continued growth and strength of the chip business if you are seeing opportunities for investment that are currently underfunded or not funded at all such that you could further increase the R&D budget beyond maybe what beyond what you traditionally would have been able to as we go into {DATE},3,83,1,0.0,0.024096385542168676,0.024096385542168676,0.03614457831325301,0.024096385542168676,1.38630252,18.1,25947.995,11,0.410446087,4.69536,2007-Jul-26,AET
Thank you for that The same characterization holds true there it is on the radar screen but no apparent change from the recent,2,23,1,0.0,0.0,0.043478260869565216,0.0,0.0,1.648281674,18.1,62247.24,10,0.242700955,1.24724,2007-Jul-26,AMGN
There are a few more weak links in the portfolio that look,1,12,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08333333333333333,1.648281674,18.1,62247.24,10,0.242700955,1.24724,2007-Jul-26,AMGN
And that accretion is pretty small,1,6,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.648281674,18.1,62247.24,10,0.242700955,1.24724,2007-Jul-26,AMGN
First question as it relates to the RPM outlook with the EPA rules drafted and out there with decisions on demand response Have you guys gotten more or less enthusiastic about the outlook for this auction From what you thought you were seeing at the {DATE} comp,3,47,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02127659574468085,0.02127659574468085,1.322167687,18.1,8617.3776,12,0.6960180859999999,0.57723,2007-Jul-26,RCL
Is that due to people or actual rig equipment,1,9,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.322167687,18.1,8617.3776,12,0.6960180859999999,0.57723,2007-Jul-26,RCL
You have a definite sense that you are taking some share from the other existing participants,1,16,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.941034022,18.1,5290.83789,12,0.777830592,0.7128399999999999,2007-Jul-26,PHM
And with that just be the revenue impact Or would that include also any related expenses like comp on the higher revenue,2,22,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.627679197,18.1,5054.882000000001,6,0.399469237,2.13343,2007-Jul-26,WDC
Okay Can you remind us how much new capital you will file for recovery of or you 'll be adding to the rate base in {DATE},2,26,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.627679197,18.1,5054.882000000001,6,0.399469237,2.13343,2007-Jul-26,WDC
Okay And on the Gibbs Bruns the final hearing is in {DATE} I guess the deliberations could extend for {DATE} after that Do you have any idea I guess you said {DATE} You hope to get the final resolution in {DATE},5,41,1,0.0,0.024390243902439025,0.024390243902439025,0.0,0.0,1.286072307,18.1,522711.1233,4,0.306813049,2.04592,2007-Jul-26,XOM
Makes a lot of sense And for my follow up you guys have mentioned customer pulls in a number of areas You specifically talked about Mike even some of the areas where you traditionally have n't had the strength I 've heard you guys comment over {DATE} that some of the greatest pull from customers is in the process diagnostics area Is that still number {CARDINAL} on the list of where you 're seeing the customer pulls,5,77,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.025974025974025976,0.0,1.777563719,18.1,5490.57288,12,0.860126828,3.85531,2007-Jul-26,DHI
Thank you good {TIME} Lynn or Steve just wanted to clarify a couple of quick things {CARDINAL} is you 've kept a pretty wide range for your {DATE} guidance All of that will come up in {DATE} Is it fair to say that that wide range is primarily driven by the Ohio capacity ruling That would be the string factor Is that the way to think about,7,67,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.014925373134328358,0.0,1.777563719,18.1,5490.57288,12,0.860126828,3.85531,2007-Jul-26,DHI
I 'm calling in for Smitty I was hoping you guys could just help us quantify the Hurricane Sandy impact I think {DATE} you mentioned maybe a negative {CARDINAL} bp impact to payroll revenue So would you say that the benefit {DATE} has been approximately the opposite a {CARDINAL} bp benefit positive,4,52,1,0.0,0.038461538461538464,0.057692307692307696,0.057692307692307696,0.019230769230769232,1.777563719,18.1,5490.57288,12,0.860126828,3.85531,2007-Jul-26,DHI
So we should have an idea of what the how that shakes out maybe by the time you report {DATE},1,20,1,0.0,0.05,0.05,0.0,0.0,1.324426629,18.1,59179.51656,7,0.776948319,0.20463,2007-Jul-26,CMCSA
Jim to follow up on your comments that nothing new on the recovery from MHI or NEO I see on slide {CARDINAL} it seems to indicate that NEO might have a communication about recovery in {DATE} but maybe not Is that sometime around {DATE} or,2,45,1,0.0,0.044444444444444446,0.08888888888888889,0.0,0.0,1.505651913,24.17,6119.68453,1,0.8759118340000001,1.1775799999999998,2007-Jul-30,TSN
And I assume you have some visibility on this so can you give us an idea of how much the portfolio turns over in,1,24,1,0.0,0.0,0.041666666666666664,0.0,0.0,1.505651913,24.17,6119.68453,1,0.8759118340000001,1.1775799999999998,2007-Jul-30,TSN
So have you got a group of assets Sandeep that you are thinking in terms of disposing of maybe {DATE},1,20,1,0.0,0.05,0.05,0.0,0.0,1.207084024,24.17,121941.288,7,0.597697312,0.36429,2007-Jul-30,VZ
Toby just as an observation first I was thinking with this {PERCENT} margin now that Dave 's not here to respond to it are n't you thinking about maybe if you know where I 'm going setting that as his incentive target goals for the balance of {DATE},2,48,1,0.0,0.020833333333333332,0.020833333333333332,0.0,0.0,1.445746675,20.87,37918.80837,4,0.7333470040000001,0.9508,2007-Jul-31,VLO
Thank you for taking my question Actually just {CARDINAL} or {CARDINAL} very quick ones Just to follow up on computing when we look at Intel they guided up their {DATE} by {PERCENT} and with expectations of recovering PC and data center Are you not seeing that or it is not apples to apples versus what they would see,4,58,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.017241379310344827,1.923678527,23.52,11709.95094,6,0.097623628,2.24781,2007-Aug-01,CTSH
Just {CARDINAL} other question on the Gas Storage Pipelines upside So you guys typically give kind of like a {DATE} look on these businesses and I know you mentioned you expect this to continue into {DATE} All else equals is this something that you see as kind of benefiting the {CARDINAL} look,3,52,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.019230769230769232,0.019230769230769232,1.923678527,23.52,11709.95094,6,0.097623628,2.24781,2007-Aug-01,CTSH
But is it fair to say I mean if the FDA agrees with the courts then that is sort of a net positive for you guys versus your prior thinking,1,30,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03333333333333333,0.0,2.216283863,23.52,6916.4449,4,0.304831894,0.4311,2007-Aug-01,SWN
Just one final Is IPPS going to be a non event,2,11,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.216283863,23.52,6916.4449,4,0.304831894,0.4311,2007-Aug-01,SWN
Okay great I guess firm would mean not down so flat to potentially increasing,2,14,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07142857142857142,0.0,1.143015633,23.52,72546.31457999999,12,0.870224168,0.8981100000000001,2007-Aug-01,TWX
Are you seeing any impact Bill as Wells Fargo I guess has now changed the name on the building and sort of beginning to make its presence better known there and I think JPM is being pretty aggressive in the market although they may be more aggressive on the loan side Are you seeing any kind of shift as the competitive situation changes there,3,64,1,0.0,0.015625,0.015625,0.015625,0.0,1.143015633,23.52,72546.31457999999,12,0.870224168,0.8981100000000001,2007-Aug-01,TWX
And then last real quickly more for Scott is there any obvious or are there obvious things you 're looking at to even further lower your debt cost given this incredible environment Or do you feel you 've pretty much done all you can do,2,45,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.022222222222222223,0.0,1.208609665,23.67,5065.485,7,0.779943315,1.7795299999999998,2007-Aug-02,CTL
Are you going to stick with your policy of not really commenting on {DATE} for any improvement now that we are mid May,1,23,1,0.0,0.043478260869565216,0.043478260869565216,0.043478260869565216,0.0,1.208609665,23.67,5065.485,7,0.779943315,1.7795299999999998,2007-Aug-02,CTL
So it sounds like you would probably rather see some of that capacity disappear than take it over yourself even if the lease stores were favorable just given format changes,1,30,1,0.0,0.0,0.03333333333333333,0.03333333333333333,0.03333333333333333,1.439098234,21.22,15964.5024,4,0.949008928,1.61596,2007-Aug-03,CHK
Morning Thanks for taking my call I hopped on a little bit late if you already answered these I apologize Just I guess real quick Explorer of the Seas sounds like there were some issues needed to come back to port Does n't seem like a real big deal Do you think that will end up being at all material to your {DATE},6,63,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.015873015873015872,1.691268788,22.94,5403.14388,4,0.862046152,0.259,2007-Aug-07,PXD
Sure okay Thank you very much for that And my second question maybe a bit bigger picture on {PERCENT} EPS range how do you see over {DATE} well particularly maybe on {DATE} where do you see things shaping up a little bit closer to the higher or lower end,4,49,1,0.0,0.04081632653061224,0.04081632653061224,0.0,0.02040816326530612,1.691268788,22.94,5403.14388,4,0.862046152,0.259,2007-Aug-07,PXD
I guess also I wanted to include ITO It seems like as we look at the BPO market increasingly technology is a critical element of BPO So would your investments include trying to stimulate more growth in ITO which has had a couple quarters of flat growth,3,47,1,0.0,0.0,0.02127659574468085,0.0,0.02127659574468085,1.691268788,22.94,5403.14388,4,0.862046152,0.259,2007-Aug-07,PXD
Right There is no requirement as to the level of purchase power that you will prefer,2,16,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.691268788,22.94,5403.14388,4,0.862046152,0.259,2007-Aug-07,PXD
And just a follow up on Time Warner Cable Just to be clear you 're not against the concept of buying it in if that is what you end up determining is the best course of action,2,37,1,0.02702702702702703,0.0,0.0,0.02702702702702703,0.02702702702702703,1.634786639,22.94,4571.6579999999985,12,0.246806647,6.9595600000000015,2007-Aug-07,IPG
{CARDINAL} Okay But no further just to reiterate no further buyback Even though you have {CARDINAL} left you 're not assuming any further buybacks in your guidance,4,27,1,0.0,0.0,0.037037037037037035,0.0,0.0,0.947323035,22.94,3290.1579,5,0.35804609,0.20702,2007-Aug-07,CHD
Secondly on the TCE ratio at {PERCENT} obviously that is still quite high Is there a level at which you would feel that you would need to raise common equity again,2,31,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.947323035,22.94,3290.1579,5,0.35804609,0.20702,2007-Aug-07,CHD
Were there some start up costs in {DATE} {CARDINAL} as well,1,11,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.947323035,22.94,3290.1579,5,0.35804609,0.20702,2007-Aug-07,CHD
Okay Great And then {CARDINAL} last question I 'm curious as you talked to your customers when do you get a sense that they will have their budgets quote unquote finalized or at least at a level where they have some conviction in the budgets,3,45,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.022222222222222223,0.044444444444444446,0.947323035,22.94,3290.1579,5,0.35804609,0.20702,2007-Aug-07,CHD
Yes that 's helpful Lastly just real quick here I wanted to ask since you 're in the number {CARDINAL} studio maybe who better to ask about the your opinion on the upcoming box office future exchanges coming up to you What is your view on that Do you feel on balance it 's net positive or negative for the industry,5,61,1,0.0,0.01639344262295082,0.01639344262295082,0.03278688524590164,0.01639344262295082,0.947323035,22.94,3290.1579,5,0.35804609,0.20702,2007-Aug-07,CHD
Understood really appreciate that color With these big number that you 're talking about with the vertical program understanding that just planning on drilling the {CARDINAL} Atoka wells {DATE} is there any horizon beyond the Atoka that might be prospective for a test {DATE},2,44,1,0.0,0.022727272727272728,0.022727272727272728,0.0,0.0,1.645627929,22.94,179102.0225,6,0.178910242,1.50956,2007-Aug-07,CSCO
Okay Then just switching over to transmission you had mentioned a lot of potential growth As you think about the financing and structuring of that do you think much about different options in terms of how to finance that Some folks of thought about a pure play transmission approach Or is it something we should just assume would very likely just continue to be funded sort of organically within FirstEnergy,5,70,1,0.0,0.0,0.014285714285714285,0.0,0.0,1.341639818,22.94,4523.34204,5,0.205919381,3.17543,2007-Aug-07,IFF
Thanks Good {TIME} So just reviewing your commentary earlier on how we think about equity And if I look at page {CARDINAL} I look at the different line items what 's been previously incurred versus estimated for {DATE} versus estimated for future periods And then I look at page I believe it was page {CARDINAL} and I use the equity factors That should get me to what the equity needs are in {DATE} and beyond Correct,8,76,1,0.0,0.0,0.013157894736842105,0.013157894736842105,0.0,1.341639818,22.94,4523.34204,5,0.205919381,3.17543,2007-Aug-07,IFF
Great thank you And then again on the TRV I do n't know if this is a question you could ask When we look at what that marginal rate could potentially be is there any type of range you can give on that Whether it 's a {PERCENT} statutory rate or whether it could end up being different by the time you get out and get this transaction done,4,69,1,0.0,0.043478260869565216,0.043478260869565216,0.014492753623188406,0.014492753623188406,1.341639818,22.94,4523.34204,5,0.205919381,3.17543,2007-Aug-07,IFF
But as it relates to CCP and the skilled nursing deals that would be I imagine the higher end of that range so {PERCENT} Is that the range that you guys are thinking about for new deals,2,37,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.904811715,22.94,19100.9611,8,0.611747999,2.68328,2007-Aug-07,FE
So would it surprise you if they got interested in real estate in the future or have those conversations not happened,1,21,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.904811715,22.94,19100.9611,8,0.611747999,2.68328,2007-Aug-07,FE
Okay And then that {MONEY} authorization given the magnitude of that potential buyback it appears that signals a strong degree of confidence in your overall reserve position,2,27,1,0.0,0.037037037037037035,0.037037037037037035,0.037037037037037035,0.0,1.537188038,22.94,22544.334,8,0.7972217970000001,1.99673,2007-Aug-07,DUK
Good {TIME} Keith could you just give a perspective perhaps on your maybe {CARDINAL} or {CARDINAL} best growing end markets in {DATE} I mean for instance how did auto hold up And oil and gas was presumably your better market but just {CARDINAL} best markets,4,45,1,0.044444444444444446,0.06666666666666667,0.08888888888888889,0.08888888888888889,0.0,0.988815093,21.45,26594.56272,9,0.308884686,1.00397,2007-Aug-09,CAH
Hi You guys talked about making some smaller changes to your marketing expenditures What are you thinking about that on a seasonal basis Would it still make sense to ramp up marketing a little bit more in peak seasonal time periods,4,41,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.585005843,28.3,20021.7744,9,0.193469016,1.11699,2007-Aug-13,SYY
Okay that 's what I wanted to confirm so {PERCENT} is adjusted for that,1,14,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.771721191,26.57,12581.7042,9,0.172325318,1.58333,2007-Aug-14,TJX

Okay So I was thinking like asset sales or other settlements and things like that,2,15,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.771721191,26.57,12581.7042,9,0.172325318,1.58333,2007-Aug-14,TJX
Okay And then in an unrelated question are you planning any more store closures for {DATE},2,16,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.125,1.585796011,26.57,69568.76408,9,0.329513144,1.46575,2007-Aug-14,HD
Okay Just to be clear I think you said the operating margins will be greater than {CARDINAL} in {DATE} Does that suggest it will be {PERCENT} in {DATE} here,3,29,1,0.0,0.034482758620689655,0.034482758620689655,0.034482758620689655,0.0,1.585796011,26.57,69568.76408,9,0.329513144,1.46575,2007-Aug-14,HD
Okay that 's fine Just last quickly did you have any cancellations in {DATE},2,14,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07142857142857142,1.585796011,26.57,69568.76408,9,0.329513144,1.46575,2007-Aug-14,HD
Just want to turn to the Bakken projects Can you give us a little sense of the counter parties what kind of contracts you have there Can you talk about what the volumes are like now where you see them going We 've heard about another pipeline that 's proposed to take the liquids to the north Is there enough volume to fill both,5,64,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.733915035,26.57,29960.0027,3,0.274826429,3.79049,2007-Aug-14,AMAT
And then there has been talk in the European papers about the possibility of larger scale staffing acquisitions I know you have been conservative in the past about only really doing smaller deals But if there was an opportunity where you could greatly expand your international presence at an attractive price would you consider it,3,55,1,0.0,0.01818181818181818,0.03636363636363636,0.05454545454545454,0.0,1.9954787,30.67,9800.3,6,0.1103557,1.6169,2007-Aug-16,ADSK
And when you and momentum carrying into,1,7,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.012770032,30.67,11639.03,9,0.15127555199999998,1.13135,2007-Aug-16,JWN
So really {DATE} over year we should see that 's where it kind of anniversaries then right,1,17,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.2596728930000003,26.33,50314.48501,9,0.307266258,0.04302,2007-Aug-21,TGT
Would you benefit more for the rates here in the US or in the EU or is it {PERCENT} Which rates may work better,2,24,1,0.0,0.041666666666666664,0.041666666666666664,0.08333333333333333,0.0,2.2596728930000003,26.33,50314.48501,9,0.307266258,0.04302,2007-Aug-21,TGT
Okay and as far as acquisition multiples would you say it 's still in the historical range {CARDINAL} to {CARDINAL} times or is it closer to the {CARDINAL} times now,1,30,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.604177026,26.33,16641.75492,9,0.272135775,0.0893,2007-Aug-21,SPLS
Okay and Peter you are guiding OpEx flattish sequentially despite the big revenue down tick Are there any {CARDINAL} time items in SG&A and R&D in {DATE} or is the run rate reflective of investments for future opportunities,2,38,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05263157894736842,0.0,1.604177026,26.33,16641.75492,9,0.272135775,0.0893,2007-Aug-21,SPLS
Thanks John And Erik I 'm sorry if I missed this in your comments Did you provide move outs to home ownership {DATE} and maybe an update on rent to income,3,31,1,0.0,0.03225806451612903,0.03225806451612903,0.0,0.03225806451612903,1.938694314,25.25,3755.60724,9,0.220666415,0.60946,2007-Aug-22,ROST
Good {TIME} thanks for taking the questions Can you talk about the current state of client pricing pressures and more specifically the degree to which you think marketers are trying to get like for like services for lower prices and then you make it up by selling additional services Or alternately do you feel like there 's situation where is you have pricing power for your services,3,67,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.014925373134328358,0.014925373134328358,1.938694314,25.25,3755.60724,9,0.220666415,0.60946,2007-Aug-22,ROST
Okay and then so how do we think about historically boring product mix Historically {DATE} has been {DATE} Is that is it I would expect given what flu was {DATE} that that trend would continue Is there any reason to not think that that would occur,5,46,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.938694314,25.25,3755.60724,9,0.220666415,0.60946,2007-Aug-22,ROST
Right Right That 's why I heard you say that And I thought okay does that mean that once these mature you walk away from that and dial that back down,4,31,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.174246622,22.89,2412.29043,9,0.6628552870000001,5.4333800000000005,2007-Aug-23,FL
A question on the healthcare business I was wondering if you could maybe give a little color on the drivers of the growth particularly how much is from new clients versus your existing clients just running more volume through the business Or how much of it is from those same clients maybe buying more products within the suites you offer,2,60,1,0.0,0.05,0.05,0.0,0.016666666666666666,2.163920645,26.48,19166.55594,9,0.312777039,3.08741,2007-Sep-18,KR
And to your point you 've the best indicator of your pace of cash write offs are really these past due accounts,1,22,1,0.045454545454545456,0.0,0.0,0.045454545454545456,0.0,1.827616424,26.48,7308.82256,9,0.050398183,0.26282,2007-Sep-18,AZO
Okay fair enough Just as a follow up to that just curious about what pressure on recently renewed contracts you may be experiencing from your clients just coming back saying I hear pricing is continuing to drop and what else can you do for me Have you found any reopening like that,3,52,1,0.0,0.019230769230769232,0.019230769230769232,0.0,0.0,1.827616424,26.48,7308.82256,9,0.050398183,0.26282,2007-Sep-18,AZO
So you would guarantee the bonds essentially,1,7,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.854336476,20.03,22519.13088,3,0.246752232,10.4611,2007-Sep-20,NKE
And the average price remains below Ross Stores is that reasonable,1,11,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.252558946,20.03,13263.56694,1,0.403183044,2.60513,2007-Sep-20,CAG
Is that going to be made by Canada or other areas picking up,1,13,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.252558946,20.03,13263.56694,1,0.403183044,2.60513,2007-Sep-20,CAG
Could you review what are your highest per unit price states for Aggregate product,1,14,1,0.07142857142857142,0.07142857142857142,0.07142857142857142,0.07142857142857142,0.0,1.252558946,20.03,13263.56694,1,0.403183044,2.60513,2007-Sep-20,CAG
What is client retention running currently,1,6,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.708005243,20.03,29508.6726,12,0.46814674,3.6321,2007-Sep-20,CCL
Okay And then lastly internationally where are you starting to see pressure to remove fuel surcharges,2,16,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.163704694,19.25,26849.337880000006,11,0.323466697,5.79606,2007-Oct-16,STT
Okay and do you think the fact that the case was filed before the legislation was passed is a significant issue,1,21,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.163704694,19.25,26849.337880000006,11,0.323466697,5.79606,2007-Oct-16,STT
And just last question on this With the assuming the combination of the {CARDINAL} competitor PBM 's is approved does that change the I guess with more consolidation does that put pressure on the retail margins Is that a significant change as you see it or not,3,47,1,0.0,0.0,0.02127659574468085,0.0,0.02127659574468085,2.163704694,19.25,26849.337880000006,11,0.323466697,5.79606,2007-Oct-16,STT
I would agree we have n't seen a decline So if someone was to offer you what you thought was good value given the current environment might you crystallize a little bit,2,32,1,0.0,0.03125,0.03125,0.03125,0.03125,2.163704694,19.25,26849.337880000006,11,0.323466697,5.79606,2007-Oct-16,STT
Lastly any major really significant changes throughout {DATE} I know you do n't give {DATE} data but if there was any significant change in trying to slow down as {DATE} progressed if you could highlight that And if that would any reason we should n't expect very good growth that you can see you have {DATE} in to,3,58,1,0.0,0.017241379310344827,0.017241379310344827,0.034482758620689655,0.017241379310344827,2.252149648,20.02,15697.26054,11,0.29713785800000003,2.71457,2007-Oct-17,NTRS
So how much more even small improvements do you see Is there {DATE} {DATE} Consistently I realize directionally there 's probably {DATE} but how long should we just see consistent every {CARDINAL} kinds of improvement and when does that get just very difficult to do,4,45,1,0.0,0.0,0.022222222222222223,0.044444444444444446,0.022222222222222223,2.252149648,20.02,15697.26054,11,0.29713785800000003,2.71457,2007-Oct-17,NTRS
All right And that 's what 's giving you the confidence that is really going to be the bottom in breast meat or in chicken in the chicken cycle,2,29,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.252149648,20.02,15697.26054,11,0.29713785800000003,2.71457,2007-Oct-17,NTRS
Okay And then lastly on Europe can you give a little bit more color in terms of where in Europe not necessarily geography geographically where you saw the weakness but from a product line basis was it more in diagnostics or research or,2,43,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.023255813953488372,1.574340137,20.02,29625.42429,10,0.192140625,0.2357,2007-Oct-17,SYK
Thanks this is Kurt Schoen filling in for Mark Do you expect the logistical issues in the ports in South America to in any way affect your fertilizer shipment,2,29,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.574340137,20.02,29625.42429,10,0.192140625,0.2357,2007-Oct-17,SYK
So do you that notwithstanding do you feel any better about the quality of the estimate now than you did last time you spoke with us,1,26,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.038461538461538464,0.0,2.50751642,20.02,18802.84113,12,0.998658823,3.1230900000000004,2007-Oct-17,CSX
So it 's kind of a {DATE} process,1,8,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.888709019,20.02,152647.5486,11,0.692526669,1.1415,2007-Oct-17,JPM
Just curiously on Marmaxx during {DATE} with there any regional call outs when you think about some of the trends that occurred during {DATE},1,24,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.06292958,18.54,25061.91625,11,0.578502384,1.49804,2007-Oct-18,STI
And is it a cost savings measure a capital efficiency measure or do you really think that well design just gives you the best performance,1,25,1,0.04,0.0,0.0,0.08,0.0,2.06292958,18.54,25061.91625,11,0.578502384,1.49804,2007-Oct-18,STI
And then the CapEx is there is that because I know initially kind of thinking that role is over as well but because the Nanjing gets extended is that changing thinking there at all,1,34,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.06292958,18.54,25061.91625,11,0.578502384,1.49804,2007-Oct-18,STI
Hi there I 'm here with Michael Bilerman as well Just in terms of the potential acquisition pipeline I know in the past you 've given some goal posts or given a size or a potential size of what the pipeline might be Could you give us a sense of what that might be,3,54,1,0.0,0.05555555555555555,0.05555555555555555,0.0,0.0,2.04533091,18.54,6927.184520000002,11,0.539552201,0.46208,2007-Oct-18,ZION
Hi good {TIME} everyone Just {CARDINAL} questions {CARDINAL} is a housekeeping question and {CARDINAL} is more a bigger picture In terms of your corn estimate does that include basis or exclude basis,4,32,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03125,0.0625,1.606878559,18.54,15544.89405,10,0.24206975100000006,1.8315,2007-Oct-18,STJ^A17
Okay And {PERCENT} that you settled with in Iowa on the wind plant when will IUB rule on that,2,19,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.11531098,18.54,21260.78864,11,0.493757161,2.04156,2007-Oct-18,BBT
Is interest only money available,1,5,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.358017305,18.54,222000.7706,11,0.556342411,2.24841,2007-Oct-18,BAC
Okay When you talk about the credit crunch maybe having a substantial role in this what else should we think about because it seems like the credit crunch seems to show up in strange places at strange times What other do you have any other additional thoughts as to what we might want to think about in terms of the credit crunch in terms of trading and marketing or the power markets in just any further thoughts on that,3,79,1,0.0,0.02531645569620253,0.05063291139240506,0.0,0.0,1.358017305,18.54,222000.7706,11,0.556342411,2.24841,2007-Oct-18,BAC
Secondly maybe for you as well Tim are you hearing from clients that they are concerned at all about this Russian litigation Is it having any impact on your ability to generate your business Are people concerned about it,3,39,1,0.0,0.02564102564102564,0.02564102564102564,0.0,0.07692307692307693,1.358017305,18.54,222000.7706,11,0.556342411,2.24841,2007-Oct-18,BAC
Just wondering in terms of capital raising potential going forward what forms you might prefer to pursue,1,17,1,0.0,0.058823529411764705,0.058823529411764705,0.0,0.0,4.323558135,18.54,9044.83448,10,0.165776988,9.56748,2007-Oct-18,ISRG
Did it always operate at a loss,1,7,1,0.14285714285714285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14285714285714285,1.6444784769999998,18.54,39681.1128,10,0.060643773,1.60624,2007-Oct-18,GILD
Okay I would also assume then that E&P on a stand alone basis and Midstream on a stand alone basis would have more volatility than if you combined the {CARDINAL} correct,2,31,1,0.0,0.0,0.06451612903225806,0.0,0.03225806451612903,1.6444784769999998,18.54,39681.1128,10,0.060643773,1.60624,2007-Oct-18,GILD
And on that point I would assume some of these drugs are still potential for price at least in the US not these but some of the other drugs that are doing better,1,33,1,0.0,0.0,0.030303030303030304,0.030303030303030304,0.0,1.100286034,18.54,170060.526,10,0.429414736,2.19745,2007-Oct-18,PFE
Well there 's a reason for everything I guess The share count number got bumped up I think year to date you are looking at something in the {CARDINAL} {CARDINAL} range What 's {DATE} ending share count in that number,4,40,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.902561796,18.5,16106.08176,6,0.441446741,0.93545,2007-Oct-19,XRX
Don I just wanted to follow up I wanted to see if I could get the full aggregate numbers I think you talked about acquisition costs marketing costs demo costs I guess it was being {MONEY} {DATE} or {MONEY} greater {DATE} Do you have just the aggregate numbers,4,48,1,0.0,0.020833333333333332,0.020833333333333332,0.020833333333333332,0.0,1.991712199,18.5,133058.0721,4,0.140060245,1.01869,2007-Oct-19,SLB
And then {DATE} presumably was on the lower end given the challenges,1,12,1,0.0,0.0,0.08333333333333333,0.0,0.08333333333333333,0.964755529,18.5,67808.87076,10,0.175488232,0.3385,2007-Oct-19,MMM
Do you have a rough split of these various end markets on the SBQ side or maybe just the top {CARDINAL} what percentage it might account for,1,27,1,0.0,0.07407407407407407,0.07407407407407407,0.0,0.0,1.573923605,18.5,5475.05439,1,0.856232995,5.33333,2007-Oct-19,MHK
Certainly does n't appear so but your competitor announced significant components supply issues or problems and it does n't look like you had any problems You were able to navigate that issue Is that correct,3,35,1,0.0,0.0,0.02857142857142857,0.02857142857142857,0.05714285714285714,1.573923605,18.5,5475.05439,1,0.856232995,5.33333,2007-Oct-19,MHK
And do you anticipate that will come within {DATE} or,1,10,1,0.0,0.0,0.1,0.0,0.0,2.216719606,18.5,16234.47096,11,0.439794815,6.355169999999998,2007-Oct-19,FITB
But you are not planning to put more cash in the LP just to be clear on that,1,18,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.216719606,18.5,16234.47096,11,0.439794815,6.355169999999998,2007-Oct-19,FITB

Okay And in terms of your success in locking down some of these deals obviously if you can double the income in a short period of time that is quite attractive to your sales as well as anyone else out there What do you think it is that is about GGP that is allowing you to win these deals,3,59,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05084745762711865,0.0,1.091887049,22.96,28575.58968,3,0.209590277,0.54901,2007-Oct-22,KMB

As we made the changes in distribution on the equipment side in Asia and you mentioned Japan and China in particular have there been I realize the sales impact of those changes but has there been some disproportionate cost impact there as well,2,43,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.023255813953488372,1.5041976069999998,21.64,17081.449,12,0.244872612,1.57906,2007-Oct-23,OMC

Hey Steve Couple questions {CARDINAL} is it true that when the commission cap comes in effect that that really has a minimal effect on your property that you 're not really paying commissions much over {CARDINAL} anyway,3,37,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02702702702702703,3.370171134,21.64,6634.19376,7,0.056673804,0.64946,2007-Oct-23,LVLT

Yes I did actually On the gross margins on {DATE} i.e. any reason you did n't do a little better Was it just that you despite the revenue upside it was offset by a bigger drain in inventory than you were initially targeting,3,43,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046511627906976744,0.0,1.719029625,21.64,6775.045120000002,6,0.073000188,1.0388700000000002,2007-Oct-23,WAT

Thank you very much for taking the call Actually a follow up on David 's question Does American consider the way it rewards customers now as a strategic advantage over the other legacy carriers,3,34,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058823529411764705,0.029411764705882353,1.879549997,21.64,5055.5816,12,0.179524455,1.36083,2007-Oct-23,EFX

Got it Thanks Carol Just one follow on You have the {MONEY} of incremental synergies partly offset by the higher labor Is there anything that would enable you to offset that labor inflation in subsequent {DATE} post the synergies,5,39,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02564102564102564,0.0,2.000186995,20.41,39056.24632,3,0.247462958,1.97611,2007-Oct-24,GLW
Okay And then is it definitive that the point or still the volume of the impact still up in the air I mean to what extent is there still some uncertainty around this,3,33,1,0.0,0.0,0.030303030303030304,0.0,0.0,2.000186995,20.41,39056.24632,3,0.247462958,1.97611,2007-Oct-24,GLW
So you think you 're there in say like the Second Bone Spring and Avalon or are you still experimenting in some of the other formations or do you think you 're pretty much there on all of them at this point,1,42,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.919403934,20.41,10991.71122,10,0.294187336,0.36515,2007-Oct-24,DGX
Okay And then the last thing if I could ask I know you said there were a lot of great things going in the business I think the numbers speak for themselves but can you talk about where your biggest concerns are what 's keeping you up at {TIME} anything that 's on the horizon that you 're very mindful of that you would point to,3,66,1,0.0,0.015151515151515152,0.015151515151515152,0.015151515151515152,0.015151515151515152,1.250624206,20.8,292357.4688,6,0.112495596,8.0,2007-Oct-25,MSFT

so even if it 's a net positive in {DATE} you still had some concessions that had to be made Right,2,21,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047619047619047616,0.0,3.839087745,20.8,3836.03094,12,0.777830592,2.4315,2007-Oct-25,PHM
Thanks good {TIME} guys A couple of follow up questions So the first one Bill in terms of the increased lost business or increased attrition rate of the customers do you think that is primarily a function of the macro environment or is there any change in the competitive landscape in particular some of the growth initiatives at GNK or maybe with Aramark not being private for {DATE} maybe aggressively attacking the cost structure but also being aggressive with pricing anything you are seeing with those {CARDINAL} or any other competitors that are sort of changing the landscape,3,98,1,0.0,0.02040816326530612,0.02040816326530612,0.01020408163265306,0.030612244897959183,1.405744246,20.8,27019.608160000003,8,0.64927314,0.03684,2007-Oct-25,SO
Got it And so it sounds like you 're well within your comfort zone there If you could comment with regard to it sounded like on the last call you 'd suggested that the accretion from MedServe was kind of more backend loaded Does the integration process or anything else really kind of cause you to take your foot off the gas when it comes to acquisitions Or kind of business as usual here,6,74,1,0.0,0.013513513513513514,0.02702702702702703,0.0,0.0,1.579700286,20.8,49556.1978,7,0.776948319,0.06961,2007-Oct-25,CMCSA

Good {TIME} all Question for you on the tremendous improvement in what I would call network velocity or fluidity Both velocity and terminal dwell improved over {PERCENT} It was {TIME} when we talked about headcount being up {PERCENT} I guess if you adjust out the people on the retention board it 's only up {PERCENT} year over year Is there still some room if volumes remain roughly where they are to perhaps tighten down on the headcount a bit or am I missing something here,6,85,1,0.0,0.011764705882352941,0.023529411764705882,0.047058823529411764,0.011764705882352941,1.748250535,20.8,27072.14554,5,0.091912403,0.64026,2007-Oct-25,CELG
Thank you And speaking of Mechanical Security at the ISC show you demonstrated what may not be your first but it was certainly the first that I saw demonstrated integrated a network mechanical door that would be networked with CSS Can you speak a little bit about the if you want to call it the convergence of getting your Mechanical and your Electronic businesses together particularly at the door,3,69,1,0.0,0.014492753623188406,0.014492753623188406,0.0,0.0,1.801530235,20.8,56212.17378,10,0.194296315,0.92188,2007-Oct-25,BMY
Is that the CUE category growing faster or are you gaining incremental share and if it is share are there specific areas where you feel like you 're making the most progress,1,32,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0625,0.0,1.180509563,19.56,10070.55,6,0.103461055,5.1639599999999986,2007-Oct-29,PBI
Thank you so the follow up is that does that mean that potential debottlenecking of trains {CARDINAL} through {CARDINAL} is something that could potentially precede a Train I mean I understand there are {CARDINAL} different tranches of potential expansion Does that change the debottlenecking opportunity to move that forward or is that still something that would follow if it did in fact follow,3,63,1,0.0,0.015873015873015872,0.015873015873015872,0.015873015873015872,0.0,1.3761205630000002,19.87,2494.22872,10,0.481674381,0.56908,2007-Oct-30,UHS
Tammy just a point of clarification on the spoilage I think you said it was not included in the roughly flat PRASM guide Should I assume that could only if anything be a good guide or because it 's an off peak carry potentially could it break the other way or is that already in that flat number,3,58,1,0.0,0.034482758620689655,0.08620689655172414,0.017241379310344827,0.017241379310344827,2.355996301,19.87,8663.0502,3,0.213612415,3.7226,2007-Oct-30,FTI^A17

Good {TIME} Thank you Just a few questions here First I do n't think to Christy 's earlier question I do n't think you guys responded on a yield for Crown So if you can just give us a sense of what the initial yield is And then is GAAP going to make you mark the street retail rents and the office rents to market So that the GAAP yield will be more reflective of what the actual cash yield will eventually be Or GAAP will say you can use the existing rents that are there right now It 's not going be mark to market,9,106,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.009433962264150943,0.018867924528301886,2.017474759,21.07,12513.71308,8,0.694817895,0.57471,2007-Oct-31,NBL

Got you Then John I think in the past you have mentioned that when the macro environment does slow down that has been a pretty good time for you to get more active on the M&A front Have you seen now that pipeline improve a bit here,3,47,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0425531914893617,0.02127659574468085,1.885989889,21.07,4635.16672,5,0.205919381,1.1547,2007-Oct-31,IFF

Would there be an opportunity to actually extract cash then from the Power book And for someone else that maybe would see an opportunity in some of your assets to capitalize on an opportunity to invest in little cash now is there a way for you guys to cash some of that out then,2,54,1,0.0,0.018518518518518517,0.018518518518518517,0.05555555555555555,0.0,2.440704086,18.53,3488.01936,9,0.282120276,2.44923,2007-Nov-01,AAP
You intend to stay ahead just be being having the lowest costs and you can always you will be competitive against anybody because your costs will be better than anybody else 's,1,32,1,0.0625,0.0,0.0,0.03125,0.03125,2.440704086,18.53,3488.01936,9,0.282120276,2.44923,2007-Nov-01,AAP
And with regard to small business the increase in problems which you highlighted is that more in the problem markets like California and Florida or is it more of a product issue or both,1,34,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058823529411764705,1.2227095,18.53,20313.24594,10,0.219878856,0.69947,2007-Nov-01,BDX

Okay Great Just on the price and I was n't trying to throw off the question of how much has already been posted it was more just if you had a feel for how much was rolling over {DATE} or is that again you just would n't have the dates run,4,51,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0196078431372549,0.0196078431372549,2.282896277,18.53,4879.6524,12,0.246806647,6.01041,2007-Nov-01,IPG

Thanks Doug given the changes in credit card terms and the outlook for consumer spending how likely is it that we could see {DATE} growth in credit card receivables turn negative {DATE},1,32,1,0.0,0.03125,0.03125,0.0,0.03125,2.328382736,24.1,9350.4642,6,0.14563915,7.417289999999999,2007-Nov-14,NTAP

Hi thanks this is Vincent Lin sitting in for Julio Just a question on the constant currency revenue growth guidance It sounds like the {DATE} guidance implied some a less decline for the rest of {DATE} than the {PERCENT} decline you posted {DATE} I just wanted to make sure that it was just purely a function of easier comparison moving through {DATE} Or is there something else we should be expecting,5,71,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.014084507042253521,0.04225352112676056,2.006912179,24.1,25788.08171,3,0.292626327,0.97325,2007-Nov-14,AMAT

I wanted to ask a tactical and a strategic question on R&D and I noticed your spending increased {DATE} so my question tactically would be to what extent should we expect in {DATE} forward that that level continue to increase from {DATE} And then the strategic question is as you think about where you invest the incremental R&D dollar is there a shift in the size of the program that you 're targeting the requirements for the clinical for the program and maybe ultimately for the magnitude of the pricing premium that the targeted program will achieve,2,97,1,0.0,0.010309278350515464,0.010309278350515464,0.010309278350515464,0.030927835051546393,2.388387782,25.49,2171.9268,3,0.291961577,4.6184,2007-Nov-19,TDG
Okay and then just to follow up on that To what extent are you reducing CAM expenditures that you typically capitalize And could that potentially reduce your recovery ratio The recoveries that you are getting from tenants that not that it 's a huge percentage the {PERCENT} But the tenants that are not on fixed CAM that recovery declines,5,59,1,0.0,0.01694915254237288,0.01694915254237288,0.0,0.01694915254237288,2.388387782,25.49,2171.9268,3,0.291961577,4.6184,2007-Nov-19,TDG
And asking a similar question on the commercial side are you seeing the interagency white paper on change in how you look at commercial real estate more focused on cash flows versus appraisals are you seeing that have an impact on how you look at nonperformers or is it slowing down the inflow of new NPLs,1,56,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03571428571428571,2.568615362,25.49,7939.559690000001,9,0.15127555199999998,4.6573,2007-Nov-19,JWN

It is Ross Nussbaum {CARDINAL} final question The {PERCENT} same store NOI growth you generated {DATE} if I think about that relative to the occupancy gains you have and the releasing spreads over {DATE} it feels like there is something else that is helping that number Is there a piece there that I am not thinking about,4,57,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.017543859649122806,0.017543859649122806,1.698330331,21.68,4888.46537,1,0.376281346,0.07156,2007-Dec-20,CTAS

Okay Then just looking at that {DATE} even if you assume that the paper had a part of it there has been a substantial increase like {DATE} Is it safe to say that the {DATE} period and {DATE} were sort of low single digits as a level you are unlikely to ever go back to at this point even if paper softens somewhat,3,63,1,0.0,0.015873015873015872,0.031746031746031744,0.0,0.0,1.698330331,21.68,4888.46537,1,0.376281346,0.07156,2007-Dec-20,CTAS

Right I understand the other options Okay And Larry the mortgage on D.C. to from what we can understand was the largest hotel mortgage done {DATE} You sound moderately with optimistic that you 'll do what I 'm assuming would be an even larger {CARDINAL} on San Diego Is that fair And can you comment on size limits in the mortgage market,7,62,1,0.0,0.0,0.016129032258064516,0.016129032258064516,0.0,2.462759152,23.68,7872.96,11,0.723750198,3.66546,2008-Jan-14,MTB
And so has that had negative impact on Bard,1,9,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1111111111111111,2.787641012,22.9,32773.44116,11,0.360227828,0.32469000000000003,2008-Jan-15,STT
Do you have all the distribution you 'd want to have or is there still gains to be made,1,19,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05263157894736842,0.0,2.467928943,23.34,131573.7535,11,0.838316407,0.47835,2008-Jan-16,JPM
Good {TIME} I was just wondering if you could tell us I appreciated the discussion of potential impact of Reg E I just wonder if you can tell us of the {MONEY} in service charges on deposits how much of that was consumer and NSF fees,2,46,1,0.0,0.021739130434782608,0.021739130434782608,0.021739130434782608,0.0,2.467928943,23.34,131573.7535,11,0.838316407,0.47835,2008-Jan-16,JPM
Hi couple of questions {CARDINAL} just to start clarifying Your {CARDINAL} to {CARDINAL} run rate was that personal auto or personal insurance,3,22,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045454545454545456,3.427957241,24.38,4552.42535,11,1.100464332,0.7148,2008-Jan-17,HBAN
Keith could you remind us just as you think about Europe overall what percentage is Germany France versus Belgium and the UK just the revenue contribution,1,26,1,0.0,0.038461538461538464,0.038461538461538464,0.0,0.0,3.427957241,24.38,4552.42535,11,1.100464332,0.7148,2008-Jan-17,HBAN
Does that mean that the development yields are still intact even though let 's say that new lease rent was slightly lower than what we saw in {DATE},1,28,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.427957241,24.38,4552.42535,11,1.100464332,0.7148,2008-Jan-17,HBAN
And other revenue would then be in that {MONEY} range {MONEY} {MONEY} range then,1,14,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.751418642,24.38,5614.67637,6,0.246280238,3.76183,2008-Jan-17,XLNX
Okay So we can expect it to normalize back to where it 's been over {DATE},2,16,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.740450614,24.38,15489.192830000002,11,0.7543996740000001,0.76747,2008-Jan-17,BBT
All right So theoretically the incremental sales volumes that you would be selling would it largely be coming out of inventory as opposed to incremental production,2,26,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.038461538461538464,2.846962066,28.46,98670.98617,4,0.12648193800000002,0.7795,2008-Jan-18,SLB
So is it just stay steady and hope for the best,1,11,1,0.09090909090909091,0.0,0.0,0.09090909090909091,0.0,2.846962066,28.46,98670.98617,4,0.12648193800000002,0.7795,2008-Jan-18,SLB
Okay Maybe {CARDINAL} quick follow up if I might Again sorry back on margins within the Media Networks group I think when you back out the digital deal it looks like you guys expanded margins nicely in {DATE} on year It occurs to me it sounds like the international margins are probably still a drag I was wondering if you could confirm that they are holding you back a little bit But as things maybe pick up from a macro standpoint into {DATE} that that could be a real source of opportunity,7,92,1,0.0,0.05434782608695652,0.06521739130434782,0.010869565217391304,0.010869565217391304,2.846962066,28.46,98670.98617,4,0.12648193800000002,0.7795,2008-Jan-18,SLB
And then last Rob I think all of us see a stacked up pipeline of diagnostic startup out there Are you getting approached to more and more for companies trying to leverage your distribution channel What are the dynamics happening there,3,41,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.208394341,28.46,4549.075,11,0.8665564640000001,0.50403,2008-Jan-18,PBCT
Any degree or any qualitative comment as to how much,1,10,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.129641257,28.46,20074.26992,3,0.386754815,1.69967,2008-Jan-18,JCI^I16
Just wondered a second what 's the expectation for process growth for {DATE} at this point I know that it was a little bit below expectation for {DATE} How are you thinking about the puts and takes there,3,38,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.781223718,27.18,7354.12275,6,0.073405455,5.76516,2008-Jan-22,WAT
Got you Okay Then I guess more of a strategy question We have seen some really good growth metrics in the RIDEA portfolio and the outlook for {DATE} is positive Would you ever look to convert some of the triple net leases over to operating assets Or will you look to grow shop more through new investments,6,57,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03508771929824561,0.017543859649122806,1.781223718,27.18,7354.12275,6,0.073405455,5.76516,2008-Jan-22,WAT
Wachovia Congratulations on {DATE} I would like to dive a little bit deeper into the gross margin line You had said that {CARDINAL} basis points from the Komag acquisition It would be very helpful to understand where the remaining sequential {CARDINAL} basis points came from be it mix shift in terms of capacities and where I 'm trying to get to is that if I look at the mix of business towards mobile are we starting to see mobile carry a better than average gross margin for the Company,5,89,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.011235955056179775,0.0,1.781223718,27.18,7354.12275,6,0.073405455,5.76516,2008-Jan-22,WAT
All right So George just so I do n't want to belabor this but just so I understand you 're saying the door 's open if Walgreens wants to come back At this point you 're not in discussions and you do n't feel that they offer anything that 's differentiated in the marketplace so you 're willing to move forward without them is that the right characterization,3,68,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.1223817460000003,27.18,141815.4314,6,0.11317161,1.48844,2008-Jan-22,AAPL
Fantastic And are you guys doing anything differently in the back half marketing wise to maybe further boost traffic or drive home the values,2,24,1,0.0,0.041666666666666664,0.041666666666666664,0.08333333333333333,0.0,3.1223817460000003,27.18,141815.4314,6,0.11317161,1.48844,2008-Jan-22,AAPL
Hello Good {TIME} The question is on the Robert Half Technology business It continues to have very strong growth but it actually decelerated the growth rate {DATE} constant currency growth rate versus {DATE} more than some of the other segments given the strong demand and shortages and all of that Is that just that it had been growing so quickly that it 's a tougher comps issue or is there some softening within that business,5,75,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04,0.02666666666666667,3.1223817460000003,27.18,141815.4314,6,0.11317161,1.48844,2008-Jan-22,AAPL
Okay And what kind of leverage do you get on {PERCENT} comp or any at all,2,16,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.1223817460000003,27.18,141815.4314,6,0.11317161,1.48844,2008-Jan-22,AAPL
Sure Okay And then any changes in contract duration or anything on that side that should skew maybe our calculation of deferred and contribution of maintenance going forward into {DATE},3,30,1,0.0,0.03333333333333333,0.03333333333333333,0.0,0.0,2.241741088,27.18,159646.2985,11,0.777654022,1.36438,2008-Jan-22,BAC
Thanks Safra there 's been concern over sales cycles extending out beyond what we 've seen over {DATE} Can you just help us better understand if there 's been any change to the duration of what you 've seen in the sales cycle,3,43,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.023255813953488372,0.023255813953488372,2.241741088,27.18,159646.2985,11,0.777654022,1.36438,2008-Jan-22,BAC
Great That 's good to hear And finally with regard to Mervyn 's and Boscov 's there is no other charges left to be had there in terms of reserving for anything on a go forward basis correct,3,38,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05263157894736842,0.0,2.241741088,27.18,159646.2985,11,0.777654022,1.36438,2008-Jan-22,BAC
So in other words looking at that {PERCENT} increase we should n't infer any kind of that you 're anticipating those levels of sales growth In other words {PERCENT} plus type sales growth,2,33,1,0.0,0.0,0.030303030303030304,0.0,0.0,3.063142267,27.18,12038.3872,11,0.683696966,3.32608,2008-Jan-22,FITB
And you think the well is,1,6,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.063142267,27.18,12038.3872,11,0.683696966,3.32608,2008-Jan-22,FITB
I guess {CARDINAL} questions First one is could you talk a little bit about the decline in non cat weather I guess that surprised me I thought when you have snow in all {CARDINAL} states at the same time and not all {CARDINAL} of those states were cat events I would have thought non cat and cat weather would be up {DATE} But you and Chubb both were saying that non cat was down So can you is there a categorization thing or {DATE} things were just below the cat threshold and {DATE} there were a lot of events just above,6,101,1,0.0,0.009900990099009901,0.009900990099009901,0.0,0.019801980198019802,3.063142267,27.18,12038.3872,11,0.683696966,3.32608,2008-Jan-22,FITB
Okay That is helpful And RIS it 's been mentioned a few times that normally like {DATE} always seems to be a seasonally stronger quarter and so it seems activity on the RIS side looks also positive Should we see an incrementally higher benefit in {DATE} versus the first,4,49,1,0.02040816326530612,0.0,0.04081632653061224,0.061224489795918366,0.0,2.169839907,27.18,17313.1015,12,0.824011397,14.2584,2008-Jan-22,CSX
get kind of that mid single digit core,1,8,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.169839907,27.18,17313.1015,12,0.824011397,14.2584,2008-Jan-22,CSX
We should look for that to be turned around in {DATE} kind of thing,1,14,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.576709268,31.01,21240.87554,11,0.806189327,1.18636,2008-Jan-23,STI
I got you And maybe also on the same strategic side I know with regard to the cash position as well as other potential receipts from the downstream sale I know there was originally an intent to look for attractive assets to acquire to further diversify the production base Is that still the plan as well as you see it going forward,4,62,1,0.0,0.016129032258064516,0.016129032258064516,0.016129032258064516,0.0,3.527976992,31.01,5293.405,6,0.399469237,18.82916,2008-Jan-23,WDC
To show that these is there some burden that has to be met in terms of making the retirement decision with the regulators or is it just you are the operator you own the assets you can do to your professional discretion,1,42,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.023809523809523808,3.527976992,31.01,5293.405,6,0.399469237,18.82916,2008-Jan-23,WDC
Okay So nothing changed when you went about doing this search That did n't prompt a further review of anything as far as succession goes,3,25,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.527976992,31.01,5293.405,6,0.399469237,18.82916,2008-Jan-23,WDC
And John just as a follow up On the security side particularly in the Carrier space pertaining to the Gi firewall who are you running into most often and who do think you 're taking share from,2,37,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.4348624209999998,31.01,66467.27792000001,3,0.283671692,0.53646,2008-Jan-23,UTX
Okay And then maybe just on Wahler attacking from a little bit of a different angle it seems like engine margins would have been high this quarter ex Wahler So if I just try to extrapolate on what you said going forward is a low double digit incremental in the engine business what you guys are expecting for this {DATE} inclusive of Wahler,3,63,1,0.0,0.015873015873015872,0.031746031746031744,0.0,0.0,1.4348624209999998,31.01,66467.27792000001,3,0.283671692,0.53646,2008-Jan-23,UTX
Okay that 's great And then there is a distressed situation Towergates in the UK You said in the past you 're not interested in it I just wonder given the situation over there do you see organic opportunity from that from competitors such as hiring brokers or getting new business,4,51,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0392156862745098,0.0196078431372549,2.493402134,31.01,8793.77524,12,1.057054199,1.43929,2008-Jan-23,LUV
Sure Then looking at your expectations in terms of the details that you gave us for {DATE} and going back at your expectations given in {DATE} are you planning in getting to the levels you gave us in {DATE} by {DATE} For example the gross margin you expect to be {PERCENT} in {DATE} and you have {PERCENT} and I understand that things are going to improve as you go along throughout {DATE} Do you think you can still reach those targets either on the gross margin and on the SG&A by the time you reach {DATE},4,96,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.010416666666666666,0.0,2.059961817,31.01,59525.67296,6,0.22771721,1.68537,2008-Jan-23,QCOM
Great And maybe {DATE} more on strategies with Turquoise Ridge you guys obviously earn {PERCENT} What do you see for Newmont going forward Do you guys have a strategy to maximize that investment,4,33,1,0.0,0.030303030303030304,0.030303030303030304,0.030303030303030304,0.0,1.611080449,31.01,4194.7262,3,0.269883356,4.14142,2008-Jan-23,AME
And I guess just sort of follow up Peter do you worry about any sort of slow down or pause in front of Leopard I know historically you have n't really seen that in the Mac business ahead of launches but anything different with an installed base that tends to be more heavily weighted towards traditional Windows users,2,58,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.034482758620689655,1.611080449,31.01,4194.7262,3,0.269883356,4.14142,2008-Jan-23,AME

Hi Banc of America {CARDINAL} questions The guidance you provided there was some language saying that it includes potential special charges Are you expecting something in {DATE} of size or magnitude,4,31,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03225806451612903,4.381011868,31.01,1736.2582899999998,6,0.245558794,0.2132,2008-Jan-23,FFIV
I did n't think I was going to make it I just have a I quick one I 'll make it fast for you The second quarter margins are they based on your guidance are they going to be the high spot for the year or do you think that you can continue to make progress as we move through {DATE},4,61,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01639344262295082,0.0,4.381011868,31.01,1736.2582899999998,6,0.245558794,0.2132,2008-Jan-23,FFIV

In response to that question earlier about whether or not certain long product assets may or may not become available to the market how do you think about valuation in a scenario like that as a strategic buyer of construction oriented long products Obviously we 're probably not going to see anything close to what we 've seen over {DATE} from a buying perspective How do you think about how you might value something like that if certain of those assets became available,3,83,1,0.0,0.03614457831325301,0.04819277108433735,0.0,0.012048192771084338,1.855245771,29.02,7695.37974,6,0.337602422,2.48073,2008-Jan-24,KLAC
Yes hi Good {TIME} David you talked earlier about how the joint venture with Macerich carved up But I do n't think you mentioned was there any consideration to sell those assets outright,4,33,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.030303030303030304,0.0,1.855245771,29.02,7695.37974,6,0.337602422,2.48073,2008-Jan-24,KLAC

Wondering if I can switch over to Brazil I know you mentioned that you would see gradually improving production rates down there I 'm trying to maybe get a little bit sharper pencil on that Really what I 'm trying to get at is thinking about the impact on profitability in {DATE} I assume it 's a drag as it was in {DATE} but less of a drag and I do n't know as we end {DATE} is that business breakeven or is that too optimistic,5,86,1,0.0,0.011627906976744186,0.023255813953488372,0.03488372093023256,0.023255813953488372,1.733779432,29.02,48643.25,10,0.363488475,0.63579,2008-Jan-24,AMGN
I want to echo everyone 's thoughts and best wishes going forward for Bill and Gene Most of my questions have already been answered As a follow up to Faisel 's earlier Lane do we have any sort of no go no go time line on the Alky unit that you guys have talked about Obviously a little bit lower scope and scale of a project but just wondering if you have a similar sort of thing for us to at least keep an eye out for,6,87,1,0.011494252873563218,0.0,0.0,0.011494252873563218,0.011494252873563218,1.629745089,29.02,38894.03782,10,0.188023246,1.1068,2008-Jan-24,BAX
Okay A final one then I think {DATE} {DATE} that you guys put some position in the Bakken up in Canada Is that essentially at this point that you have determined that this really do n't have a future in the portfolio or that you are still looking at it,4,50,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.942429842,29.02,30729.63424,12,0.782258687,3.20424,2008-Jan-24,UNP
Real quickly when you think about the impacts of the service levels obviously you talked about on the cost side do you think you left any money on the table on the intermodal product in terms of your ability to take prices up especially in a tight truckload market,1,49,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.942429842,29.02,30729.63424,12,0.782258687,3.20424,2008-Jan-24,UNP
Okay Fair enough And {CARDINAL} smaller thing the Analyst Day you also mentioned the opportunity for some re gas maybe in Hawaii Obviously not maybe as large an opportunity as some of the stuff you mentioned in {DATE} but just wondering if that 's something you have an idea about the capacity that that market might demand eventually And that 's probably I would guess a lower priority than any of the projects that you 've spent so much time discussing already {DATE},5,83,1,0.0,0.03614457831325301,0.04819277108433735,0.024096385542168676,0.0,2.112225747,27.78,4841.423,5,0.489414481,5.4697,2008-Jan-25,EMN
Thanks The clean energy Doug I think you said it is running around how you thought Could you add some color It 's tough for us to get visibility Do you still think that business could be up materially {DATE} compared to {DATE},5,43,1,0.0,0.046511627906976744,0.046511627906976744,0.0,0.0,2.112225747,27.78,4841.423,5,0.489414481,5.4697,2008-Jan-25,EMN
Hi good {TIME} It 's actually Mike Sang in for Nigel I had a quick question on the restructuring The realignment that you guys announced Could you give a sense on how that phases through {DATE} So the {MONEY} that you alluded to Frank how much of that came in and how much of that do you expect in,6,59,1,0.0,0.01694915254237288,0.01694915254237288,0.01694915254237288,0.03389830508474576,1.646577062,29.08,109138.7475,7,0.52005578,0.18829,2008-Jan-28,VZ
But could that be in property or casualty,1,8,1,0.0,0.125,0.125,0.0,0.0,1.619013224,29.08,16791.2976,9,0.193469016,0.41834,2008-Jan-28,SYY
And so are there any assets or heavy suburban portfolio assets that you 're going to look to sell over the balance of {DATE} or is it kind of put on the shelf for now,1,35,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.443915847,27.78,55232.45376,10,0.202388005,1.28385,2008-Jan-29,MMM
I think you said in response to a prior question that you could make money on {MONEY} of revenue So with {MONEY} as your target are there any specific profitability targets attached to that Or how did you arrive at that What goals do you want to accomplish with that number,4,51,1,0.0,0.0196078431372549,0.0196078431372549,0.0392156862745098,0.0196078431372549,1.443915847,27.78,55232.45376,10,0.202388005,1.28385,2008-Jan-29,MMM
But your guidance for trading assumes is there any mark to market implied in there,1,15,1,0.0,0.0,0.06666666666666667,0.0,0.0,3.362666893,27.78,17651.27029,2,0.250645574,1.71378,2008-Jan-29,PCAR
No just what you 're seeing in the Bone Spring versus and I was just citing the wells you put in the press release as far as the Permian well or the Bone Spring wells looked to have higher IPs by {QUANTITY} or so {QUANTITY} on those {DATE} rates I was looking at that versus,3,55,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.362666893,27.78,17651.27029,2,0.250645574,1.71378,2008-Jan-29,PCAR
Back to GCIB for a moment if you take the {MONEY} in revenue loss {DATE} you 've gone around the edges of explaining this but I was hoping maybe you could do it slightly more clearly How much of that do you think is in marks versus trading losses versus just revenue short falls from the weak market,3,58,1,0.017241379310344827,0.034482758620689655,0.034482758620689655,0.0,0.05172413793103448,3.362666893,27.78,17651.27029,2,0.250645574,1.71378,2008-Jan-29,PCAR
And your attitude to the future will you continue to review that situation,1,13,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.362666893,27.78,17651.27029,2,0.250645574,1.71378,2008-Jan-29,PCAR
Okay Do you happen to have the {DATE} split Given what was {DATE} to date you 're seeing RASM up {PERCENT} What do you see capacity sort of {DATE},4,29,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.578751605,27.78,3929.9128,12,0.230246776,2.60783,2008-Jan-29,RHI
Do you expect your loans to decline {PERCENT} {DATE} somewhere in that range,1,13,1,0.0,0.0,0.07692307692307693,0.0,0.07692307692307693,2.578751605,27.78,3929.9128,12,0.230246776,2.60783,2008-Jan-29,RHI
Okay And a related question on staffing overall Given the higher complexity that 's expected in the returns {DATE} is there a related staffing increase needed for that reason or is it more you 'll be increasing the investment in training your current people that you mentioned,3,47,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02127659574468085,2.569317621,27.78,3745.9947,5,0.35452223200000005,0.28651,2008-Jan-29,ALB
Yes Is there an agreement now for the dash {CARDINAL},2,10,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.569317621,27.78,3745.9947,5,0.35452223200000005,0.28651,2008-Jan-29,ALB
There 's discussion of well difficult times for renewable energy providers and I guess I 'm going to ask the question would you be interested in acquiring any assets instead of building,1,32,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0625,2.314800556,27.78,30218.9364,4,0.5994311179999999,1.69586,2008-Jan-29,VLO
Are you thinking PPAs or what 's the self build opportunity,1,11,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09090909090909091,0.0,2.723782116,27.32,14462.274,9,0.118084531,0.55328,2008-Jan-30,SBUX
Yes so going forward then should we assume a similar type relationship between say your sales numbers and then the SG&A growth as we saw in {DATE},1,27,1,0.0,0.0,0.037037037037037035,0.0,0.0,2.816540405,27.32,8642.417440000001,12,0.74933566,0.75365,2008-Jan-30,RCL
Okay and secondly I was just curious regarding you talked about the BRIC markets being up {PERCENT} I believe in Flavors and just an overall healthy tone to emerging markets Are you not seeing any signs of consumer slowdown to the degree you can read through your customer base Some of what has been tremendous category growth in those regions but of late there 's been a lot of signs that these BRIC markets are slowing down or are unable to deal with the inflation so there 's a pullback by consumers Are there any signs you 're seeing through your customer base of category growth slowdown,5,107,1,0.0,0.0,0.009345794392523364,0.009345794392523364,0.04672897196261682,1.588156431,27.32,19965.39384,10,0.201470977,2.4350400000000003,2008-Jan-30,AGN^C15
Any update on PSYO synergies I think you talked about the potential there for {CARDINAL} {CARDINAL} basis points of improvement over {DATE} and {DATE} Any change in your thought process or timing there,3,33,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.030303030303030304,0.0,1.5576370940000002,27.32,48825.51228,12,0.202364585,0.23146,2008-Jan-30,UPS
Okay And then just along those lines in terms of your in store inventories can you talk about how fast the inventory is turning now versus how fast it was turning before you got on this inventory reduction initiative,2,39,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.775961401,27.32,27545.8812,3,0.338671991,1.84322,2008-Jan-30,ITW
I guess in relation to the idea that you are tooled up for {MONEY} in revenue as you just said and the revenue is lower than that {DATE} can I then safely assume that lead times did n't do much during {DATE} They kind of stayed where they were,2,49,1,0.0,0.0,0.02040816326530612,0.0,0.0,2.598693206,27.32,9423.35114,11,0.554014341,0.5421699999999999,2008-Jan-30,LM
It was n't clear to me whether you answered this in response to AJ 's question but as far as the EPS guidance that you 're giving are you reaffirming that kind of ex the Medicare boost,1,37,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02702702702702703,0.02702702702702703,2.598693206,27.32,9423.35114,11,0.554014341,0.5421699999999999,2008-Jan-30,LM
Okay so it 's fair to say that there could be some potential opportunities to work more with some other carriers,1,21,1,0.0,0.047619047619047616,0.047619047619047616,0.047619047619047616,0.0,2.705011199,27.32,11109.53475,11,0.334396587,2.26779,2008-Jan-30,BXP
Okay good I 'm glad I asked that And then to look the a couple more follow ups To look at the PGI outflow that Jim talked about from the {CARDINAL} accounts my understanding is that {CARDINAL} of the accounts was nationwide pulling funds from Morely which was always going to happen anyway Jim do you happen to know that number,4,61,1,0.01639344262295082,0.0,0.0,0.01639344262295082,0.0,2.0985539280000003,27.32,7630.6944,3,0.476587194,3.01511,2008-Jan-30,DOV
Okay And do you have any sense for why the volumes slowed down I guess at those customers,2,18,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05555555555555555,1.968969213,26.2,29722.1177,11,0.361454001,2.07386,2008-Feb-01,AFL
Right But that ultimately could be monetized through the MLP as you think about it going forward Is that fair,3,20,1,0.0,0.05,0.05,0.0,0.0,2.380263797,27.62,2357.3996,9,0.111655731,0.28868,2008-Jan-31,HBI
And as a quick follow up turning to the Revenue Cycle to what degree have you looked at or are you changing your Revenue Cycle solutions to address the increase and high deductible health plans that are being sold in the market {DATE} going forward and the increasing direct patient payment portion of the overall healthcare spend as it relates to your clients Revenue Cycle needs,1,66,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.453096203,27.62,27230.943010000006,6,0.5022400920000001,9.3065,2008-Jan-31,RTN
Okay Is it fair to say it 's not on the order of magnitude of the mortgage related projects that you just finished comping against or is it that big of an impact,2,33,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.030303030303030304,1.453096203,27.62,27230.943010000006,6,0.5022400920000001,9.3065,2008-Jan-31,RTN
Okay So is it fair to say that your comments or your outlook your goal of achieving positive operating leverage in {DATE} that 's something that you 're targeting with regardless of whether the deal closes,2,36,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05555555555555555,0.0,1.757445069,27.62,17854.24212,8,0.398484106,1.11012,2008-Jan-31,PPL
Helpful Finally can you give an update on what DAS is doing in the optical department I did n't see any optical side I did n't hear that was necessarily a driver but it had been in the past Is it still as strong as it had been,6,48,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.020833333333333332,0.0,1.757445069,27.62,17854.24212,8,0.398484106,1.11012,2008-Jan-31,PPL
First question just touching back on labor for a minute if we can It 's been widely talked about that there has been labor constraints in the market but our feeling was that it was kind of isolated to markets like Colorado and Texas Are you seeing more of a widespread impact at this point,3,55,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01818181818181818,5.585505301,27.62,3474.31353,12,1.5942709919999998,4.51353,2008-Jan-31,PHM
Right Okay And then the Health business did you send out cancellation notices to consumers Did that spark some additional flurry of utilization And if so what was the timing on that Has that stabilized,6,35,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02857142857142857,0.02857142857142857,2.413222551,27.62,7467.66999,6,0.182649554,1.2182,2008-Jan-31,VRSN
And then finally if I can sneak {CARDINAL} more in SG&A it was a little above my number but I think it was well within what you guys had been talking about as far as forward outlook Are you planning on spending more or less through {DATE} into {DATE} And what on that line item,3,55,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.413222551,27.62,7467.66999,6,0.182649554,1.2182,2008-Jan-31,VRSN
Okay And last question if you had to guess when you look at PDI same store sales when would you think it would stabilize and maybe see a positive inflection point {DATE},2,32,1,0.0,0.03125,0.03125,0.0625,0.03125,2.989743856,26.2,19931.20372,11,0.145735192,0.2874,2008-Feb-01,SPG
Got it And just in terms of the Raymarine business are you guys seeing sort of a turnaround there at this point Or should we just perceive consistent results if the macro environment persists,3,34,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.029411764705882353,2.989743856,26.2,19931.20372,11,0.145735192,0.2874,2008-Feb-01,SPG
And then secondly a follow up in the flavor side I 've seen a few specialty chemical companies recently talk about their specialty food ingredients businesses I 'm not talking about bulk ingredients but the specialty additives in food And they 're looking to build out Would you benefit or do you think you could create value by partnering in the food ingredient area beyond flavors,5,66,1,0.0,0.015151515151515152,0.015151515151515152,0.015151515151515152,0.0,1.404099059,25.99,24262.0248,8,1.025789506,1.14325,2008-Feb-05,DUK
Ken just a follow up on the investment bank You had a lot of different heads in the investment bank {DATE} Could {CARDINAL} potential improvement measure be a joint venture or acquisition to gain some additional experience,3,37,1,0.0,0.02702702702702703,0.02702702702702703,0.05405405405405406,0.0,2.468645233,25.99,6306.4174600000015,2,0.630411936,1.60693,2008-Feb-05,WHR
Okay That 's helpful And then separate topic Bob was hoping you could comment on the implications of GE 's acquisition in artificial lift Obviously it validates the attractiveness of the space but now you 've got a bigger competitor bigger capitalization You 'll likely see more pressure as they try to consolidate this space How does this impact your outlook for the business near term longer term,6,68,1,0.0,0.014705882352941176,0.014705882352941176,0.014705882352941176,0.0,1.177268108,25.99,5456.56038,8,0.6493169639999999,4.13133,2008-Feb-05,WEC
Quick question here Obviously you mentioned it a little bit on furloughs and you had some very good productivity numbers in {DATE} Is the network rightsized for the current volumes or is there a little bit more work to do as we move throughout {DATE},3,45,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.022222222222222223,0.022222222222222223,1.757340207,28.24,55664.7784,12,1.218332369,0.13047999999999998,2008-Feb-06,TWX
And is it too early to talk about retention {DATE} and what the impact of some of the price increases might have been on customer retention,1,26,1,0.0,0.038461538461538464,0.038461538461538464,0.0,0.0,1.757340207,28.24,55664.7784,12,1.218332369,0.13047999999999998,2008-Feb-06,TWX
So as I look at new client growth as given normalized retention and your {PERCENT} price increases is that adequate to grow as the payroll business {PERCENT},1,27,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.757340207,28.24,55664.7784,12,1.218332369,0.13047999999999998,2008-Feb-06,TWX

Hey guys You did a good job on quantifying demand and talking about what you guys are seeing in terms of new leasing activity so far in {DATE} Could you give us a little bit of sense of what you 're seeing in terms of availability Maybe talk about the big blocks of space that remain available outside of maybe what is in your portfolio I think you guys have {CARDINAL} Park you have some space and {CARDINAL} obviously you have a little bit there {DATE} but anything else,6,89,1,0.0,0.033707865168539325,0.033707865168539325,0.011235955056179775,0.0,1.529365805,28.24,21104.0656,6,0.70010649,5.0353900000000005,2008-Feb-06,TMO

And I guess it seems that the comment about fully implemented in {DATE} that seems a little more drawn out than we 've seen previously Is that an attempt to kind of just ease into the price increases and minimize that effect,2,42,1,0.0,0.0,0.047619047619047616,0.0,0.0,2.220604636,28.24,4919.49108,12,0.16161046099999998,1.5324,2008-Feb-06,SRCL

Hello Thank you for letting me back on Given this drop at least in the price of assets I wondered what your feeling is towards merger and acquisition candidates and I know you generally talk about small tuck in type opportunities but just if you could provide some input there that would be helpful,3,54,1,0.0,0.018518518518518517,0.018518518518518517,0.018518518518518517,0.0,2.009490923,28.24,6271.48,11,1.052160082,5.49877,2008-Feb-06,CINF

Good {TIME} guys I 'm sure some of my questions have been asked as I 've been passing from conference calls here But I was wondering if you can talk about the efficiency in your drilling program Can you talk about air drilling in the project or not or whether it 's moving forward And also if you can talk about days to drill Are you seeing efficiencies there and so forth If you can comment on that,7,78,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.038461538461538464,0.01282051282051282,4.239610843,28.24,18019.89052,10,0.359766036,1.73889,2008-Feb-06,BIIB
Got it Okay Thanks for that information Going back to the drugs of abuse testing I think Brad said it was {CARDINAL} basis point drag on volume How much was it a benefit to pricing growth,5,36,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.027777777777777776,0.05555555555555555,3.017601334,28.24,4978.07935,6,0.23623007,5.3057300000000005,2008-Feb-06,AKAM
And the {MONEY} and the Nine Dragons that are currently drilling what 's the timeline for completion of drilling and then actual completion of the wells and turning those to sales Any estimate for those And also at what rate or what size do you expect those to come on at,3,51,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.836470333,28.24,5473.39301,12,0.224289955,0.35356,2008-Feb-06,RSG
Just a follow up on expense related question As we think about the {MONEY} of run rate savings you expect to get by {DATE} how should we think about that progressing from {DATE} throughout {DATE} Is it somewhat even Is it going to be back ended,4,46,1,0.0,0.021739130434782608,0.021739130434782608,0.021739130434782608,0.021739130434782608,1.499172949,28.24,4098.2394,8,0.7803349270000001,3.53557,2008-Feb-06,LNT

So if I look at your negotiating strategy obviously natural gas is going to remain low for some time no matter whose model or forecast you look at and stockpiles at {CARDINAL} {QUANTITY} are at a record for {DATE} and we are going into the shoulder Are you getting any change in posturing from utility customers Are they looking for forgiveness on take or pay or negotiated minimums Are they pushing back on price Just what does the environment feel like when you talk to utilities that clearly do n't want or need any more coal at this point in {DATE},5,101,1,0.009900990099009901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.330863252,28.97,5260.30848,2,0.431035947,2.15016,2008-Feb-07,BWA
Okay And {CARDINAL} last this is more of a strategy question is when you think about allocating capital in this sort of an environment or even a falling environment if you will in {DATE} and as you remain prudent on balance sheet and you think across your asset base will the allocation of rigs be similar to what we have right now in the Midland Basin and Shelf versus what you 're seeing in Avalon,2,75,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.013333333333333334,2.330863252,28.97,5260.30848,2,0.431035947,2.15016,2008-Feb-07,BWA
{CARDINAL} questions {CARDINAL} is over {DATE} many packaged food companies have shifted its algorithm to more of a margin focus And your repeated commentary about balance is there maybe not a sea change but a shift in how you 're thinking about your algorithm more to a cost restructuring even in both in the US and China And my second question is in terms of category adjacencies you 've had mixed performance on certain category adjacencies So trying to figure out how you 're getting more confident in moving into the snack bites the snack bars categories and how do you assess the adjacencies,5,104,1,0.0,0.009615384615384616,0.009615384615384616,0.009615384615384616,0.028846153846153848,3.292408463,28.97,7233.3712,11,0.4020786,16.10632,2008-Feb-07,AVB
{CARDINAL} quick questions Your guidance implies {PERCENT} sequential growth What growth assumptions have you made in what seems like conservative guidance And the second question is related to the immigration bill I agree with your earlier comments that buyers of IT services are not worried about the immigration bill However have you made any changes to your recruiting efforts And is there any medium to long term plan to reduce dependency on each {CARDINAL} of these,7,76,1,0.0,0.0,0.039473684210526314,0.0,0.02631578947368421,3.292408463,28.97,7233.3712,11,0.4020786,16.10632,2008-Feb-07,AVB

Good {TIME} and congratulations on very good results {CARDINAL} questions {CARDINAL} is probably going to be very quick We did n't really talk about yield expectations Should we think of something in the range of meaning {PERCENT} constant dollar or something a little less,4,44,1,0.0,0.0,0.022727272727272728,0.045454545454545456,0.022727272727272728,2.383806808,27.66,2094.8292,3,0.291961577,0.8728899999999999,2008-Feb-08,TDG

No that 's really helpful And then sometimes you 're able to give us a sense of what your larger customers are doing that you talk directly with versus the distributors Are you seeing any difference in their behavior right now Any difference in order patterns,4,46,1,0.0,0.021739130434782608,0.021739130434782608,0.021739130434782608,0.0,2.26672332,27.66,14091.18489,12,0.723893039,0.85098,2008-Feb-08,WY

Is there any validity I guess thinking back to the guidance that you gave in {DATE} on a groupwide basis the guidance excluding Costa now is probably sort of a couple of points worse than that guidance Does that provide a decent steer or is there too many other things that have occurred subsequently,2,54,1,0.0,0.0,0.018518518518518517,0.0,0.018518518518518517,2.024439586,27.6,25261.4078,3,0.292626327,3.72128,2008-Feb-12,AMAT
Hi I was wondering The year over year change in Temp staffing gross margin how much came from geographic mix shift How much came from the faster growth of Management Resources in Tech versus the rest of the business,4,39,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.024439586,27.6,25261.4078,3,0.292626327,3.72128,2008-Feb-12,AMAT
Okay And the {PERCENT} debt to cap that you 're at right now obviously is real solid and fairly low Would you be willing to take that up materially in the course of the Exego transaction or any other transaction,3,40,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.5325966219999998,27.6,14860.874,12,0.277908233,1.0,2008-Feb-12,OMC
Okay So if we 're thinking {DATE} on a run rate basis {DATE} is there a way you can give us a range of the number we should be thinking about Is it {MONEY} or {MONEY},3,36,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.5325966219999998,27.6,14860.874,12,0.277908233,1.0,2008-Feb-12,OMC
Got it I guess one final question just when you think about financing and over {DATE} really {DATE} Would you ever consider using anything other than just straight common Meaning converts or something like that We have seen some other companies in the industry use that to help finance when they have got a {DATE} high growth and CapEx plan Or from a regulatory standpoint does that make it harder to use instruments like that,6,75,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.013333333333333334,2.286121419,27.6,6898.6935,4,0.676885475,0.06486,2008-Feb-12,NFX
Last question I have is on raw materials It seems that propylene prices are really coming off sharply again and have you noticed decreases in the derivative materials that you purchase as well,2,33,1,0.0,0.0,0.030303030303030304,0.0,0.06060606060606061,2.286121419,27.6,6898.6935,4,0.676885475,0.06486,2008-Feb-12,NFX
With regard to RFID and the RBIS business in terms of incremental margins can you differentiate the {CARDINAL} so that we can understand how to think about the earnings progression as RFID way outpaces RBIS business,1,36,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.6559968669999998,27.6,13159.795,11,0.567849516,1.32124,2008-Feb-12,MMC

Does it get any easier to price intermodal product once the port clears up or did that not really have much of an impact on your pricing,1,27,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037037037037037035,0.0,3.704781179,27.6,8535.85812,11,0.230704468,0.84639,2008-Feb-12,GGP
Got it So the {PERCENT} increase in share count that you are talking about that is a general range but there could be some flexibility around that,3,27,1,0.0,0.037037037037037035,0.037037037037037035,0.0,0.0,3.704781179,27.6,8535.85812,11,0.230704468,0.84639,2008-Feb-12,GGP
Putting that all together should we expect the financial segment revenue growth to exit the {DATE} closer to mid single digits closing some of the gap we see with payments which has been by far the faster growing segment {DATE},1,40,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.025,3.704781179,27.6,8535.85812,11,0.230704468,0.84639,2008-Feb-12,GGP
Yes thank you Kathee maybe just a little bit more specifically on apparel it 's a pretty big part of the story here in terms of the discretionary recovery Can you talk more about areas in apparel or price points or how you would characterize this recovery in terms of it being part of your strategic initiative maybe a bit more detail around home in that same context Then just {CARDINAL} for Doug in terms of the comps that you talked about for {DATE} negative low single digits describing as being more likely or a more responsible view at this point any flow through by month through the quarter And also any sensitivity you 'd be willing to share with us if in fact you did start to see it go more toward a positive low single,6,137,1,0.0,0.014598540145985401,0.014598540145985401,0.0072992700729927005,0.0072992700729927005,3.533893652,27.6,13710.6756,12,0.163838235,0.6822199999999999,2008-Feb-12,WYNN
How have your any color you can give in terms of the sales activity there in the markets and communities where you have that,1,24,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.277118951,24.88,5278.5816,1,1.046431076,0.61328,2008-Feb-14,MHK
Okay And then you also mentioned looking at further asset sales outside of the FinCo Can you talk about maybe what some of the assets you 're looking at as candidates are,3,32,1,0.0,0.03125,0.03125,0.0,0.0,2.7312563030000003,24.88,6735.34186,12,0.517640239,5.10825,2008-Feb-14,VMC
A question for you on TYSABRI and PML Basically have you seen as you guys have seen more PML cases what can you tell us about antibody titers the JC virus And do you think a seroconversion test could become part of a routine monitoring,3,45,1,0.0,0.022222222222222223,0.022222222222222223,0.0,0.022222222222222223,2.7312563030000003,24.88,6735.34186,12,0.517640239,5.10825,2008-Feb-14,VMC
Okay So you think about it more from more than just the pure economics there is also a strategic membership focus that you are getting in addition to that,2,29,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.997609951,24.88,4079.75568,7,0.93657885,7.05858,2008-Feb-14,CTL
Yes Thank you for taking my question Good {TIME} I guess a multi part question for Didier or Bill Within this lost wireless manufacturing business and outside of the guarantee supply issue that you previously discussed Bill was pricing a major impact to the contract negotiation with this large customer Was this business won by a traditional competitor or one of the newer entrants into wireless test And was this business margin dilutive relative to the EMG average,7,78,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01282051282051282,0.038461538461538464,1.997609951,24.88,4079.75568,7,0.93657885,7.05858,2008-Feb-14,CTL
Okay thanks That makes sense and then is there more SG&A opportunity for some of the belt tightening that you talked about or is that something we should continue to expect,2,31,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03225806451612903,0.03225806451612903,1.111884115,25.54,4390.10395,8,0.812726222,0.89087,2008-Feb-15,SCG

Do you have a target,1,5,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.11768346,25.54,12087.26751,1,0.11813531,0.67853,2008-Feb-15,CPB
And how much flexibility do you have around the number if volumes disappoint Is it sort of {MONEY} {MONEY} that you could drop it or is it pretty much locked in now for {DATE} regardless,2,35,1,0.0,0.02857142857142857,0.02857142857142857,0.0,0.02857142857142857,1.11768346,25.54,12087.26751,1,0.11813531,0.67853,2008-Feb-15,CPB
I know I 'm sorry maybe I 'm not asking the question directly right I 'm thinking more on a go forward basis would you consider maybe reducing price to create more volume because the consumer is in such a very tough situation right now because you could maybe util get better utilization rates as volumes are better,5,58,1,0.0,0.06896551724137931,0.06896551724137931,0.034482758620689655,0.017241379310344827,1.6557153180000002,25.02,7563.895,9,0.353333764,1.30558,2008-Feb-19,GPC
Okay All right Fair enough Last question I 'll turn it over Are you suggesting perhaps that there may be more restructuring ahead as we look out to {DATE} I forget what the comment was in your formal remarks or in the press release or the presentation but you 're going to take additional actions depending on the market so could we see further cost reductions capacity reduction closures,6,69,1,0.0,0.057971014492753624,0.07246376811594203,0.0,0.043478260869565216,2.091287971,25.02,112079.9534,6,0.291952528,4.01171,2008-Feb-19,HPQ

Okay so a lot of it is the aerial so you need to poke holes sort of in the area to get an idea of where you go there right,1,30,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.211602432,25.12,13868.21684,8,0.765226172,0.36274,2008-Feb-22,PCG
All right I actually appreciate that color because it tied in It explains when you talk about the lowest cost to produce in the industry I guess that 's what you mean keeping the selling and staffing costs low,3,39,1,0.02564102564102564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.211602432,25.12,13868.21684,8,0.765226172,0.36274,2008-Feb-22,PCG
Do you think over {DATE} this could be sustainable Or do you think you 've seen some marketing and more exposure by consumers to get promotions and maybe that fizzles out Or do you think that 's going to be a sustainable,3,42,1,0.0,0.047619047619047616,0.07142857142857142,0.0,0.0,1.541560492,25.12,6972.57926,8,1.084914797,5.31816,2008-Feb-22,DTE
Okay that 's helpful Then just lastly on {DATE} kind of order rate expectations obviously you just answered it there for electronics and clearly your earlier message on not expecting book to bill to remain this strong is clear But what do you expect for orders either in total absolute terms or however you want to couch it where should our calibration be on second derivative of orders for {DATE},3,70,1,0.014285714285714285,0.0,0.0,0.014285714285714285,0.0,1.762697601,25.12,22547.52808,4,0.7554039229999999,2.8875900000000003,2008-Feb-22,CHK
Okay Thanks John Maybe Joe {CARDINAL} last quick question Look I think your confidence in Shopzilla appears to be improving here and I think you 've been pretty clear that the top priority is non US expansion But from a digital perspective are you also considering expanding that footprint,5,49,1,0.0,0.04081632653061224,0.04081632653061224,0.02040816326530612,0.02040816326530612,3.629923261,24.06,8355.06,9,0.12986483599999998,1.25986,2008-Feb-25,JWN
Thanks for taking the question Can I first clarify on Batya 's question You said the {CARDINAL} time items were a good part of the commercial decline {DATE} So how much was that and is that a sort of natural rebound in commercial revenue from {CARDINAL} to {CARDINAL},4,48,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041666666666666664,0.0625,3.629923261,24.06,8355.06,9,0.12986483599999998,1.25986,2008-Feb-25,JWN
Is there a time frame or will you actually tell us that you have finished those discussions or you know is there a process for which there is an ending and you will inform us about that,1,37,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.629923261,24.06,8355.06,9,0.12986483599999998,1.25986,2008-Feb-25,JWN
I know I understand why you do n't want to give too much away there And then maybe you could sort of playing off the last question maybe give us a thought on the level of inventory at customers How are you seeing that Obviously there is a little bit of inventory build here but do you have a sense of what those inventory levels are relative to historic levels,5,70,1,0.0,0.04285714285714286,0.04285714285714286,0.0,0.014285714285714285,2.895278868,23.03,44242.49625,9,0.34770661700000005,0.27288,2008-Feb-26,TGT
Yes Thank you The call 's been running long I just wanted to ask a quick question on the M&A pipeline Obviously we have pending changes to current tax regulation You probably have more than a couple people out there that are doing some estate planning I was wondering if you 've seen any more willingness or flexibility at the negotiating table in terms of deal terms Obviously the publicly traded asset light stocks have not done well in {DATE} So as a proxy for deal valuations maybe that suggests that things are a little bit more accommodative Is the pipeline bigger and are people more flexible How does it feel out there,11,113,1,0.0,0.017699115044247787,0.035398230088495575,0.0,0.008849557522123894,2.923736959,22.69,14708.03319,9,0.450214381,1.44785,2008-Feb-28,KSS
It is just a follow up on that Are the operating margins in Services have they been tracking relative to your expectations And do you have any is there anything that can positively offset some of the lower volumes like lower unemployment claims or something like that,3,47,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02127659574468085,0.0425531914893617,2.923736959,22.69,14708.03319,9,0.450214381,1.44785,2008-Feb-28,KSS

Okay That 's helpful And so it sounds like there 's nothing in relation to that that would prohibit you from for example pursuing an MLP structure down the road if that was something you wanted to do with this business,4,41,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.120115638,23.53,11529.92775,4,0.223515381,1.78978,2008-Feb-29,SWN
Okay On the merchandise outlook obviously live goods was very successful for you guys in the summertime {DATE} Any sort of new tests you are working on for {DATE},3,29,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.034482758620689655,0.0,3.120115638,23.53,11529.92775,4,0.223515381,1.78978,2008-Feb-29,SWN
Is a part of it that you simply do n't get in this argument because you provide so much bundled services that 's simply {CARDINAL} part of the total,1,29,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.034482758620689655,3.120115638,23.53,11529.92775,4,0.223515381,1.78978,2008-Feb-29,SWN
Right okay And then any thoughts you 'd like to provide on the proposed accounting changes from FASB on GAAP for insurance companies given that they could be substantial in terms of the and also somewhat adverse relative to how insurers present their financial positions,2,45,1,0.0,0.044444444444444446,0.044444444444444446,0.0,0.022222222222222223,1.87700969,23.53,3964.31421,12,0.472911725,2.29288,2008-Feb-29,IPG

All right And do think you guys might get a little bit better share of that if it was an Eastern facility moving down South or a Canadian facility moving South,2,31,1,0.0,0.03225806451612903,0.03225806451612903,0.03225806451612903,0.0,1.87700969,23.53,3964.31421,12,0.472911725,2.29288,2008-Feb-29,IPG
That 's very helpful Thanks And lastly Ursula and Bob could you share color on how the other parts of the Services business is performing So commercial BPO commercial ITO and document outsourcing,4,33,1,0.0,0.030303030303030304,0.030303030303030304,0.0,0.0,3.438466876,29.38,1722.3851,9,1.080979299,3.14527,2008-Mar-11,FL
How about the earlier Easter I assume that 's in the guidance Do you expect that to be a negative or not much of an issue,3,26,1,0.0,0.0,0.038461538461538464,0.0,0.038461538461538464,2.980377925,25.79,3832.61604,9,0.268502246,0.71831,2008-Mar-19,ROST
Yes thanks for taking the question Congratulations John and Manny I had a question again just about {DATE} and the softness I know you mentioned currency but did you see anything related to competition I know there 's a few competitors out there who are a little bit desperate but maybe they were accounting for the weakness at {DATE} Maybe that 's the first question The other question I had and John maybe you can help me out on this one but it comes back to product growth and services growth Is foreign what 's the makeup of the services renewals or service maintenance contracts Are they mostly foreign The reason I 'm asking is maybe the foreign buyers are they holding off on maybe some upgrades or some new purchases and they 're just sticking with their existing solutions for a little bit longer just given the currency Have you looked at that,11,154,1,0.0,0.032467532467532464,0.032467532467532464,0.0,0.032467532467532464,2.980377925,25.79,3832.61604,9,0.268502246,0.71831,2008-Mar-19,ROST

Great Just a couple of follow ups The margin improvement in Drivetrain was obviously very very strong {DATE} It seems like you posted a little bit of margin improvement as well on the Engine side like {CARDINAL} basis points {CARDINAL} basis points I was just wondering I think you have laid out the trajectory for further Drivetrain improvements pretty nicely but how do we think about the growth potential and margins And Engine are we close to levels that they are likely to be or is there some upside potential there as well,6,93,1,0.0,0.0,0.010752688172043012,0.053763440860215055,0.0,4.420997438000001,25.79,8336.3052,11,0.674837254,1.47822,2008-Mar-19,DFS
Hi this is Visal Louie for Satya Kumar {CARDINAL} of your peers {DATE} not a competitor was talking about pricing pressure in the market due to profitability of your customers And now both of you have the same set of customers I am wondering can you talk a little bit about pricing trends for KLA especially in the process control market,4,61,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01639344262295082,0.0,4.420997438000001,25.79,8336.3052,11,0.674837254,1.47822,2008-Mar-19,DFS
And then in terms of {DATE} can you just elaborate on whether there was any unusual bump up from the timing of the holiday being on {DATE} Yes {DATE} did you have any increased benefit in party or candy,3,39,1,0.0,0.0,0.02564102564102564,0.02564102564102564,0.0,2.338090147,25.79,4384.60452,1,0.376281346,0.6396,2008-Mar-19,CTAS
Okay Okay And then is it your expectation to bring down your optimization capacity down even more in {DATE} versus the {DATE} Or are you will you be comfortable with maintaining the sort of the second half optimization capacity level going forward,4,42,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.338090147,25.79,4384.60452,1,0.376281346,0.6396,2008-Mar-19,CTAS
Okay Are you seeing any additional competition from say private equity or other investors getting excited about seniors housing and MOBs Or do you expect the REITs to continue to be probably the highest bidder or lowest cost of capital in the healthcare space,3,44,1,0.045454545454545456,0.0,0.022727272727272728,0.045454545454545456,0.0,2.437961351,29.84,23448.1496,12,0.562188534,0.8324799999999999,2008-Mar-20,CCL
Just turning to the wind conversation a little bit with the range now there of {QUANTITY} for {DATE} Is that {QUANTITY} top end number is that a reflection of the kind of logistical limitations of you building that much wind in a short amount of time Or do you think there is the ability at some point to maybe surpass that given the compelling economics of wind with the tax credits still sitting out there,3,75,1,0.0,0.013333333333333334,0.013333333333333334,0.013333333333333334,0.013333333333333334,2.437961351,29.84,23448.1496,12,0.562188534,0.8324799999999999,2008-Mar-20,CCL
Got it To add to the questions about looking at the options on Supply maybe I can ask it a different way It seems like a lot of the value which you could receive from a third party would be from possibly synergies or cutting O&M costs When you look at the various options do you prefer a spin or a partnership versus an outright sale What is the best way to actually participate in some of the synergies or O&M cuts which could potentially add value to Supply,5,89,1,0.011235955056179775,0.0449438202247191,0.056179775280898875,0.011235955056179775,0.011235955056179775,1.912007975,26.08,11848.57104,12,0.127069607,0.0,2008-Mar-27,PAYX
Okay You may have mentioned this in the past but I just wanted to get a refresher here Should we expect more in the way of potential box plant closings as you complete the program,4,35,1,0.0,0.02857142857142857,0.02857142857142857,0.0,0.02857142857142857,1.5211674830000002,26.08,10673.25754,1,0.403183044,10.24724,2008-Mar-27,CAG
Okay and lastly it sounds like you consolidated your Mexican joint venture Any sense how big that was I mean was that a below the line investment and now you have the majority for you,4,35,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.5211674830000002,26.08,10673.25754,1,0.403183044,10.24724,2008-Mar-27,CAG
So I mean is that then to suggest that Biogen Idec could still participate going forward even after an acquisition of Genentech,1,22,1,0.0,0.09090909090909091,0.09090909090909091,0.0,0.0,2.9270442880000003,26.08,3103.81115,12,0.317613099,2.46983,2008-Mar-27,GPN
Okay great And then for {CARDINAL} guidance I think you said it is in line with your long term shareholder return model so because you have Orajel coming through does that mean we should look for {PERCENT} {DATE} even with the current seahead,3,43,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.023255813953488372,0.0,2.9270442880000003,26.08,3103.81115,12,0.317613099,2.46983,2008-Mar-27,GPN
First question was just a clarification What did you say specifically on {DATE} Was it that EPS would be below the bottom end of the full year range meaning below {PERCENT} down,2,32,1,0.0,0.0,0.03125,0.0,0.03125,3.816512655,22.68,4277.80953,9,0.370952659,4.8579300000000005,2008-Apr-02,KMX
Oh The UK has been importing a lot more LNG than would have been originally expected {DATE} and it sounds like the global oversupply is kind of being soaked up by the Europeans Does this change the way you view the flow of LNG in the world or is this just a temporary phenomenon in Europe,3,56,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.017857142857142856,3.816512655,22.68,4277.80953,9,0.370952659,4.8579300000000005,2008-Apr-02,KMX
You mentioned the accordion facility at the parent that you 've upsized that line {MONEY} Does that have cost implications,2,20,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.816512655,22.68,4277.80953,9,0.370952659,4.8579300000000005,2008-Apr-02,KMX
Okay Second question on guidance Do you need the outcome of both the GRC and San Bruno penalties to then give guidance Or to get {CARDINAL} or the other do think you will give it,4,35,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05714285714285714,3.816512655,22.68,4277.80953,9,0.370952659,4.8579300000000005,2008-Apr-02,KMX
Okay fair enough And then the second piece is with that in mind over {DATE} the lodging sector or in the lodging sector the {CARDINAL} stocks that have returned the most capital to shareholders have been Hyatt and Marriott And those are the {CARDINAL} that have outperformed while the {CARDINAL} that have been more reluctant to increase shareholder returns Starwood and Host are up {CARDINAL} as much And so what I 'm wondering is do you recognize that more capital return would lead to higher investor interest And given that you have meaningful free cash flow what gets you to move on this,5,103,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.009708737864077669,0.009708737864077669,2.592109656,22.68,18234.96948,9,0.253922091,2.30478,2008-Apr-02,BBY
Okay So opportunistically do you think fuel is low now you might consider maybe going to a little bit to the upper end of that range,2,26,1,0.0,0.07692307692307693,0.07692307692307693,0.0,0.038461538461538464,2.592109656,22.68,18234.96948,9,0.253922091,2.30478,2008-Apr-02,BBY
Thanks Good {TIME} Tom Toomey if you had {CARDINAL} foresight that San Francisco Bay area was about to really fall off the cliff and I know you do n't have that but let 's just pretend you do because you have really super powers otherwise what would you do Would you sell immediately right now Or would you muscle your way through it because you consider it a long term hold regardless of what might happen over the course of {DATE},5,81,1,0.0,0.012345679012345678,0.012345679012345678,0.012345679012345678,0.0,2.592109656,22.68,18234.96948,9,0.253922091,2.30478,2008-Apr-02,BBY
Good {TIME} and congratulations on {DATE} I just wanted to ask about the direction of revenues over the {DATE} timeframe You guys I think emphasized in several of your comments that this is a period where you are hedged where earnings are likely to be relatively flat and that the major impact of higher market prices will not be felt until perhaps {DATE} Nonetheless in {DATE} you all realized average revenue per {TIME} of {MONEY} on your marketed retail sales which is up by {MONEY} per {TIME} from a similar calculation {DATE} which was {MONEY} per {TIME} So the fact that you are hedged is not precluding you from realizing higher revenues on your market sales of power And I was wondering if you could help me understand how that works what is driving that Is this simply the gradual roll off of existing hedges and the impact of higher wholesale prices flowing through gradually to your top line over time If so should we expect more of that in subsequent quarters through {DATE} Or should I be thinking about this in a totally different way,9,186,1,0.0,0.010752688172043012,0.010752688172043012,0.005376344086021506,0.005376344086021506,4.184782075,22.68,61994.44809,5,0.197183912,0.60045,2008-Apr-02,MON
Okay we 'll wait for the others to report and see where we end up And then Dan on the back on Riata for a quick second And thanks for the detailed thoughts there But have you guys done a deep dive on the case report out of Ireland and why they experienced such high failure rates Is there anything you can tell us at this point that might explain those high failure rates or have you not had a chance to really dig in there,5,86,1,0.0,0.011627906976744186,0.011627906976744186,0.0,0.023255813953488372,0.977624425,23.82,186029.6715,10,0.236546242,1.91255,2008-Apr-15,JNJ

Congratulations amazing quarter So this is actually very small question and it 's a longer term question but if you are looking into going to Poland I have to believe you are looking at what is going on online with things like Guild Group and Rue La La and all those others smaller conversations out online and your CUBE is doing very well which kind of leads me down that path I am curious what your thought is about some of these businesses and possibly down {DATE} thinking or is Poland your bigger fish to fry,5,96,1,0.0,0.010416666666666666,0.020833333333333332,0.0,0.020833333333333332,0.977624425,23.82,186029.6715,10,0.236546242,1.91255,2008-Apr-15,JNJ
Thanks Good {TIME} If I can follow up on that question does the I guess recent merger of {CARDINAL} slightly smaller reinsurance brokerages does that change the competitive dynamics in your reinsurance markets,3,33,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.030303030303030304,0.030303030303030304,3.5854231480000003,22.78,143062.2227,11,0.838316407,0.16021,2008-Apr-16,JPM
On the triple net portfolio can you explain what items cause the same store NOI growth to be {PERCENT} which is pretty high You mentioned some fees rent increases,2,29,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.5854231480000003,22.78,143062.2227,11,0.838316407,0.16021,2008-Apr-16,JPM
Mark just a quick follow maybe on the DSO It was {DATE} We had to go back {DATE} in the model Is that just the subscription model Is there something about linearity in {DATE} that surprised you,5,37,1,0.0,0.02702702702702703,0.02702702702702703,0.0,0.0,1.667480569,22.78,26530.51035,3,0.338671991,1.6405,2008-Apr-16,ITW
Can I ask a follow up question since I did n't get that one answered On the domestic margins on the gross margin side in the past you have used price to defend your margins domestically Is that something you are contemplating with green coffee working against you now,3,49,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061224489795918366,1.667480569,22.78,26530.51035,3,0.338671991,1.6405,2008-Apr-16,ITW
And could you talk about some of the advantages of using molecular testing for C Diff,1,16,1,0.0,0.0625,0.0625,0.0625,0.0,3.361466254,22.78,24065.29877,11,0.489591129,1.72491,2008-Apr-16,BLK
Okay great Second {CARDINAL} from me is given what 's going on in Europe right now there seems to be some pretty incredible diesel cracks Can you describe how you see the export opportunities over there,3,36,1,0.0,0.0,0.027777777777777776,0.08333333333333333,0.0,2.452532924,22.78,23302.28051,12,0.824011397,2.53108,2008-Apr-16,CSX
How about the hand bag category Is that a strength or weakness for you any developments there,2,17,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058823529411764705,0.058823529411764705,2.452532924,22.78,23302.28051,12,0.824011397,2.53108,2008-Apr-16,CSX
Are you saying in a sense you 'll be less mass market shotgun approach and more targeted than you 've been,1,21,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.452532924,22.78,23302.28051,12,0.824011397,2.53108,2008-Apr-16,CSX
Good {TIME} Steve were there any specific institutional deals won during {DATE} on the basis solely of capital levels,2,19,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05263157894736842,0.0,3.031885227,20.53,20941.08705,3,0.31974403,1.54222,2008-Apr-17,NUE
Phil I do n't know if you can still hear me Did you mention that for {DATE} revenue you did include a potential marginal benefit from a few more individuals getting through halfway through the donut hole,2,37,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02702702702702703,0.0,2.662960169,20.53,6165.0,11,0.8665564640000001,1.55786,2008-Apr-17,PBCT
Okay shifting gears to the balance sheet of the brokerage margin loan balances as you said in the prepared remarks grew nicely in {DATE} up {PERCENT} on average and {PERCENT} period to period but we 're seeing compression still in the net yield taking away much of the revenue upside I 'm presuming that that is a mix related to customers hitting lower pricing tiers How much more of that do you think we could see over {DATE} as balances continue to grow,3,83,1,0.0,0.012048192771084338,0.024096385542168676,0.0,0.0,2.662960169,20.53,6165.0,11,0.8665564640000001,1.55786,2008-Apr-17,PBCT
Okay great And I guess just as far as why the {DATE} MC&O margin did n't move that 's more associated with the collars that you referred to,3,28,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03571428571428571,0.0,1.762858888,20.53,26097.20983,10,0.179866962,1.25547,2008-Apr-17,SYK
Okay that 's helpful And then a couple questions for Kathee You know firstly I guess in the near term with the improvement in sales momentum you 've seen since {DATE} is there anything changing in the characterization in terms of your price points good better best It sounds like your greatest share gain was some of your best customers Are you seeing any improvement as you can tell in terms of merchandise assortment or guest improvement,5,77,1,0.025974025974025976,0.0,0.0,0.11688311688311688,0.012987012987012988,2.448647914,20.53,15468.5177,3,0.222843822,1.83851,2008-Apr-17,TXT
Okay And in terms of your willingness to borrow or drive the balance sheet any harder I mean we obviously see that in select situations Has your thinking changed on that front at all,3,34,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.380117667,20.53,4556.62167,11,1.010298797,0.35875,2008-Apr-17,ZION
If I can follow up So your QCT units matched that or is it going to be different because you have maybe unusually low share now with {CARDINAL} nanometers restricted and maybe proportionally higher share in {DATE} once your restriction is over so maybe will you be more drastic than that {CARDINAL},3,52,1,0.0,0.057692307692307696,0.07692307692307693,0.0,0.019230769230769232,3.380117667,20.53,4556.62167,11,1.010298797,0.35875,2008-Apr-17,ZION
Okay And then the litigation dropped significantly {DATE} I think you said it was immaterial this quarter on the litigation provision Is that right,4,24,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.125,2.77150626,20.53,9195.825,12,1.057054199,1.71938,2008-Apr-17,LUV
And I want to clarify something that Scott said Scott did you say that you saw weakness in Southern Europe {DATE} spreading to Central and Northern Europe,2,27,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037037037037037035,2.77150626,20.53,9195.825,12,1.057054199,1.71938,2008-Apr-17,LUV

So you 're not permitted to build a steel mill anymore Or are you,2,14,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.4082158660000004,20.53,50240.56400000001,11,0.526198701,0.29638000000000003,2008-Apr-17,BK
Okay And just last question Thank you for taking all my questions Just in terms of very tactfully In your G&A as you are looking into {DATE} some of these launches if you will is that G&A level should that trend down a little bit Or is that a new starting level to which you would grow off of,6,59,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03389830508474576,3.4082158660000004,20.53,50240.56400000001,11,0.526198701,0.29638000000000003,2008-Apr-17,BK
Right Okay So it 's sort of a derivative benefit to that wing of the mall Got you And just curious on the sales side of things {DATE} I think you mentioned that B mall sales were sort of flattish and A and B plus malls were up Just curious excluding weather impacts if can net that out have things gotten any better for the B mall tenant sales,6,69,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.028985507246376812,0.0,3.4082158660000004,20.53,50240.56400000001,11,0.526198701,0.29638000000000003,2008-Apr-17,BK

Hey Good {TIME} guys So Arnold you talked about this a little bit just briefly in your opening commentary but can you talk about a little bit about your book to load position {DATE} relative to maybe where it 's been in the past in terms of historical levels,3,49,1,0.0,0.02040816326530612,0.02040816326530612,0.02040816326530612,0.0,5.462432306,20.53,1559.55888,11,1.7290587469999998,2.49428,2008-Apr-17,ETFC
Have there been any changes in pricing or your underwriting criteria that are going to impact sales in the Direct Response business,1,22,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.555055467,20.53,24470.904,6,0.32565287800000003,1.11703,2008-Apr-17,DHR
Okay In the context of your international comment is it fair to say most of that was US the growth in Genius,2,22,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.534756154,20.37,113965.5533,4,0.12648193800000002,2.0413,2008-Apr-18,SLB
I missed that one too And maybe final question maybe going back to Cedrik 's comments on Sears Do you think that anchor subleasing dynamic will accelerate in {DATE} And also is this a model that only works with A malls or do you think we could see this type of activity ramp up at the B malls,4,58,1,0.0,0.05172413793103448,0.05172413793103448,0.0,0.034482758620689655,1.898670376,20.13,4994.72784,3,0.269883356,8.52053,2008-Apr-21,AME
Okay Then also just lastly regarding the {DATE} comp you were up {PERCENT} Given the comments that you 've made about the quality of inventory would it be fair to say that the merchandise margin on that comp was pretty strong considering I 'm assuming it was pretty good {DATE} selling as opposed to such an emphasis on clearance selling,4,60,1,0.0,0.0,0.016666666666666666,0.03333333333333333,0.016666666666666666,3.125460715,20.13,171292.3502,11,0.777654022,0.71919,2008-Apr-21,BAC
And then just {CARDINAL} last one {CARDINAL} quick {CARDINAL} On the CRM side it would via the rollout of LATITUDE Anecdotally were there any hospital tenders in the past that you were excluded from due to the lack of remote patient monitoring And I suspect you 'll be able to get your fair share of those on a going forward basis Just any color on that front,5,67,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.014925373134328358,0.029850746268656716,3.125460715,20.13,171292.3502,11,0.777654022,0.71919,2008-Apr-21,BAC
Now does that also is that leading to a change in how customers view your product solution compared to your competitors Or are you finding that some competitors are still able to come in with the price point competition that they 've always done,2,44,1,0.022727272727272728,0.0,0.0,0.045454545454545456,0.0,1.376973428,20.13,59202.80895,10,0.236051344,1.43337,2008-Apr-21,LLY

At the present business level can you speak broadly and I recognize this is going to be lane by lane but about the relationship of train starts and incremental volume that is can crew starts move in line with volume additions or will there be an opportunity to improve or maintain the current incremental margin,1,55,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03636363636363636,0.0,2.774203507,20.5,3861.83104,12,0.230246776,1.43066,2008-Apr-22,RHI

Okay {CARDINAL} quick follow up on that With the recent share price decline do you think that 's something that the Board may kind of factor into its thinking,3,29,1,0.0,0.034482758620689655,0.034482758620689655,0.0,0.034482758620689655,2.04517299,20.26,6634.50295,3,0.31382506,0.5400699999999999,2008-Apr-24,NWL
And then just secondly gross margins have reached that long talked {PERCENT} range Are you still expecting gross margins to plateau from here,2,23,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.815555094,20.26,8213.06871,4,0.676885475,1.51534,2008-Apr-24,NFX
And just to elaborate a little bit I think it was Jamie that started with this question I know you have been asked it a couple of times But if I just sort of walk through what you 're talking about for {DATE} it kind of suggests that the revenue environment will get better than plus in order not to have a loss I may be doing that a little bit wrong but what I 'm driving at is there s something competitively that 's changing or is it just that the comps get easier month by month I 'm obviously cognizant of the Easter shift I know that 's a big deal for you Beyond that is there anything we should be thinking as happening competitively through the course of {DATE} that 's tail wind,6,136,1,0.0,0.014705882352941176,0.014705882352941176,0.014705882352941176,0.022058823529411766,3.497436579,20.06,12854.01327,4,0.223515381,2.75933,2008-Apr-25,SWN
Thanks for taking my call I had a question about some of the new products the and the {CARDINAL} and also your efforts in analog {DATE} you had thought that you might end up doing sequential growth in in the range of I think you said {PERCENT} and in analog something in the order of {PERCENT} and it came in considerably lighter than that {DATE} Can you help us understand what the hold up is there,4,76,1,0.0,0.013157894736842105,0.013157894736842105,0.0,0.013157894736842105,3.497436579,20.06,12854.01327,4,0.223515381,2.75933,2008-Apr-25,SWN
Thank you it does And then kind of curious if you could you quantify for us what the impact from weather was in {DATE},2,24,1,0.0,0.041666666666666664,0.041666666666666664,0.0,0.0,3.497436579,20.06,12854.01327,4,0.223515381,2.75933,2008-Apr-25,SWN
And last question for me but product growth appeared to perform much better in {DATE} And with most of the new products now in the market I guess the question is at the high end of your guidance would you expect your product growth to be positive in Or do you think this may take {DATE},3,56,1,0.0,0.03571428571428571,0.03571428571428571,0.03571428571428571,0.03571428571428571,1.145011501,20.06,4613.78435,8,0.812726222,2.56406,2008-Apr-25,SCG
Very well thanks Just a question on the European business Obviously {DATE} for volumes but it looks like the revenue capture on an FX adjusted basis was down probably I think the lowest that I see on record Just wondering both on the cash side and the derivatives side if there was anything going on there any new product introductions or different customers different customer mix that could be driving that,5,71,1,0.014084507042253521,0.014084507042253521,0.028169014084507043,0.0,0.014084507042253521,1.145011501,20.06,4613.78435,8,0.812726222,2.56406,2008-Apr-25,SCG
Understood And then over on the competitive side in general did you see anything in the way of increased price aggression at all towards {DATE} or so far in {DATE} in {DATE},2,32,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.607141179,20.06,2764.81384,10,0.57863375,8.01496,2008-Apr-25,UHS
OK The second question is about the rent are you seeing any more favorable terms for landlords for lease renewal,2,20,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05,0.05,1.897311718,20.06,5404.8865,5,0.489414481,1.49261,2008-Apr-25,EMN
Okay I will remember that if the stock goes back up A couple of questions here Gary first you were moving along pretty fast You stated a number I think it was the percentage of the increase in the unrealized loss that was due to downgrades Could you give that number again,5,52,1,0.0,0.019230769230769232,0.019230769230769232,0.0,0.057692307692307696,1.430063368,19.59,16972.6696,9,0.193469016,1.50093,2008-Apr-28,SYY
Okay Good Just trying to tease it out Second on you 've talked about business is obviously better Traffic versus ticket are more people in the stores or are they doing more per job Could you break that out for us,6,41,1,0.0,0.024390243902439025,0.024390243902439025,0.04878048780487805,0.024390243902439025,1.430063368,19.59,16972.6696,9,0.193469016,1.50093,2008-Apr-28,SYY
Hi guys A couple of questions on rate relief and some I am looking at slide {CARDINAL} here The {MONEY} granted and effective {DATE} for the BLRA how much of that got realized in {DATE} versus will show up in {DATE},3,41,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.024390243902439025,0.024390243902439025,2.780603011,19.64,23315.864,11,0.145735192,0.46637,2008-Apr-29,SPG
Hi thank you Couple questions I guess first on the pre employment drug screening can you remind us what the margin on that business how does that compare to sort of the routine and esoteric testing business,3,37,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02702702702702703,2.068175947,20.24,8412.768,6,0.331608742,1.69848,2008-Apr-30,FISV
Sure Then second question I have it is more of a numbers question and referring to page {CARDINAL} of the press release and it is just that on a Basel I basis your risk weighted assets grew by {MONEY} but on a Basel III basis they grew by {MONEY} And I was wondering if that a new interpretation of the rules or they are very different assets that you put on the balance sheet and,4,75,1,0.0,0.0,0.013333333333333334,0.0,0.02666666666666667,1.3134927159999998,20.24,5119.72054,8,0.736672215,2.73861,2008-Apr-30,CNP
So if you had to think how long that 's going to take is that going to be a {DATE} process {DATE} process Is it going to be {DATE},2,29,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.916249257,20.24,14651.727680000002,6,0.8022962779999999,3.17979,2008-Apr-30,SYMC
Okay got you and there 's no help you can really give us on kind of net interest margin going forward whether it 's up from this {DATE} 's level or down just tough to call,2,36,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.916249257,20.24,14651.727680000002,6,0.8022962779999999,3.17979,2008-Apr-30,SYMC
Okay And do you feel like it is enough of a position for {DATE} or are you continuing to look and potentially add acreage in the future,2,27,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.370636967,20.24,5952.38343,6,0.23623007,3.73834,2008-Apr-30,AKAM
Okay And last question In the slides you indicate that you expect to earn your authorized ROE on a temperature normal basis Does that mean at Detroit Edison {DATE} it 's possible or likely even that you 'll overearn {DATE} because weather is so strong,4,45,1,0.0,0.022222222222222223,0.022222222222222223,0.022222222222222223,0.022222222222222223,1.720471272,20.79,18567.84958,9,0.308884686,2.73233,2008-May-01,CAH
Okay Fair enough My follow up question here When you 're looking at the LTL growth it continued to out pace truckload throughout {DATE} Do you expect that to continue in {DATE} here,5,33,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.030303030303030304,2.644837238,20.79,7677.25875,11,0.4020786,3.5355300000000005,2008-May-01,AVB
And then if you look out to {DATE} and beyond do you see the need to continue raising equity at that kind of rate to support the growth program or is this just a rebalancing opportunity in your mind,1,39,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02564102564102564,0.0,2.644837238,20.79,7677.25875,11,0.4020786,3.5355300000000005,2008-May-01,AVB
Actually a follow on from Faisal 's question good {TIME} Back in refining and chemicals do you think {DATE} will be fully clear Or will you be fully back up in {DATE},3,32,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03125,0.03125,1.763510471,20.79,8108.75475,8,0.230153765,1.21943,2008-May-01,EQT
And then lastly you guys have again talked about the opportunity for outpatient and more benign type procedures Can you help us think about how big of an opportunity that might be for the Company I assume {DATE} sales into outpatient surgery centers and centers like that are pretty minimal So have you guys given much thought to how big an opportunity that might be,4,65,1,0.0,0.03076923076923077,0.046153846153846156,0.046153846153846156,0.0,1.620002009,20.79,5018.33856,8,0.569187442,0.55332,2008-May-01,OKE
And any service change pumping services anything along those lines that you guys are starting to see increased tightness in,1,20,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.1502360459999998,20.79,4160.16179,8,0.7803349270000001,1.41423,2008-May-01,LNT
That 's great My last one is a housekeeping item Can you guys offer what Camel Menthol 's share was in {DATE},3,22,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045454545454545456,0.0,1.1502360459999998,20.79,4160.16179,8,0.7803349270000001,1.41423,2008-May-01,LNT
Got it and you guys will be and again the way we talk about balance sheet size is just total consolidated basis right So you guys are at {MONEY} or so right now so and you would be comfortable going up almost to the {MONEY} level is that the right way to characterize that,2,54,1,0.0,0.018518518518518517,0.018518518518518517,0.0,0.0,2.753567452,20.79,7462.4235,10,0.256309002,1.98558,2008-May-01,HOLX
Okay yes no fair enough So that is what 's baked it And I guess just related to that in terms of the overall segment and just your thoughts on strategically it seems like that 's the least set of all the businesses and it has been a drag for {DATE} now on overall growth just strategically how you view that unit,3,62,1,0.0,0.0,0.016129032258064516,0.0,0.016129032258064516,2.112637197,20.79,3672.28915,5,0.158325085,2.4004,2008-May-01,IFF
But if I hear you correctly the preferences for to do a E&P acquisition versus share buybacks,1,17,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.112637197,20.79,3672.28915,5,0.158325085,2.4004,2008-May-01,IFF
Okay Then just to {CARDINAL} last point on this Given how much that capital margin moves especially under the stress scenario I guess it 's fair to assume that most of that capital margin resides in Talcott given Talcott would probably be the piece that requires more capital under that stress scenario,3,52,1,0.0,0.0,0.038461538461538464,0.0,0.038461538461538464,3.33724877,20.79,11780.59356,12,0.163838235,0.13994,2008-May-01,WYNN
Yes just a couple of questions real quick First Carol I 'm kind of intrigued by the potential to use your eCommerce business as a traffic driver {CARDINAL} of your competitors {DATE} indicated that they 're getting over {PERCENT} of their returns from their online business into their stores And I 'm wondering is it that high or maybe even higher for your business and how important do you see eCommerce as a traffic driver,4,75,1,0.0,0.013333333333333334,0.013333333333333334,0.0,0.013333333333333334,1.194520161,20.79,8954.5456,8,0.926615284,1.7361099999999998,2008-May-01,XEL
Thank you And also has you attitude towards condo crackers changed in the low oil price environment,2,17,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.5818088019999998,20.79,496207.0793,4,0.286889419,1.31475,2008-May-01,XOM
I wanted to focus on tomo for {TIME} putting some of your earlier comments into context here If we think about what the adoption curve should look like for tomo this time versus what looked like I noted that you said that you felt like you had a stronger competition this time around than last So should we assume that to mean that you guys are aiming to perhaps increase your overall market share in this business even though you have some pretty sizable competitors,3,85,1,0.0,0.011764705882352941,0.023529411764705882,0.011764705882352941,0.0,2.675525293,20.79,33176.122,11,0.563558262,2.73267,2008-May-01,PRU
And then turning back to your discussion about meeting with hospital operators and also spending some time in Europe and I know it 's a little early but what should we envision are some of the possible types of investments that could be made in a world where we are moving to more of a bundled payment system I mean what is that I think some of us have wrestled with this idea of what exactly does that free up on the real estate side since hospitals really have n't had any need to sell hospitals or much of their real estate in {DATE} based on a pretty decent cost of capital,3,112,1,0.0,0.017857142857142856,0.017857142857142856,0.0,0.0,2.675525293,20.79,33176.122,11,0.563558262,2.73267,2008-May-01,PRU
But more focused Steve on the growth side perhaps sort of growing your way out of it as opposed to perhaps paying your debt down on your way out of it,1,31,1,0.0,0.06451612903225806,0.06451612903225806,0.0,0.03225806451612903,1.45258218,18.88,5025.66441,8,1.292360881,3.0237,2008-May-02,NI
Okay If then you looked out further could you see this region moving toward the same margin as the other International regions over time,2,24,1,0.0,0.041666666666666664,0.041666666666666664,0.0,0.0,1.133012678,18.88,9668.32728,8,0.788792505,4.35092,2008-May-02,AEE
Okay And then I guess is it mostly in terms of the inflation is it mostly a function of fuel that 's changed the outlook Bob,2,26,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.889692708,18.88,3504.3534,11,0.307372819,0.11763,2008-May-02,AIV
Okay great And then relatedly do the ACQUITY related columns carry higher margins than the instrument itself at this stage of the game,2,23,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043478260869565216,0.0,2.889692708,18.88,3504.3534,11,0.307372819,0.11763,2008-May-02,AIV
{CARDINAL} quick questions In terms of your alternative business can you give us a sense of where you are seeing the stronger or weaker demand whether it is in the fund of funds or your proprietary hedge funds or the real estate or private equity products,2,46,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.021739130434782608,0.043478260869565216,2.062645331,18.88,13551.90528,12,0.723893039,0.4057,2008-May-02,WY
The one you seem to have gradually over {DATE} gotten into one market after the other and quite successfully The {CARDINAL} area you have n't gone into in a big way is energy obviously you 're in plate which is used in transmission pipe and such but any thoughts on based on the demand for China and India over {DATE} there is going to be a phenomenal demand for energy any thoughts on stepping up to that area and putting a few more resources to work in that market,2,89,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.011235955056179775,0.0,2.290633361,18.9,5262.81513,4,1.2350081309999998,1.0745,2008-May-06,XEC
Good {TIME} guys Is your understanding that the support agreement would prevent from you selling all of TFC And if that is not the case why did n't you pursue a bolder strategy like that rather than the limited wind down,3,41,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.024390243902439025,0.0,2.248694366,18.9,1869.91488,3,0.291961577,4.43887,2008-May-06,TDG
So the {CARDINAL} is not even a stabilized number the {CARDINAL} is just number,1,14,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07142857142857142,0.0,4.439536091,18.9,5032.9455,12,1.384936318,8.20469,2008-May-06,DHI
Is there a price that at perhaps it does become a good idea for you if you were to drop {MONEY} a barrel or something,1,25,1,0.0,0.04,0.04,0.04,0.0,4.439536091,18.9,5032.9455,12,1.384936318,8.20469,2008-May-06,DHI
Right but compared to the same time period for you {DATE} are you able to give a {DATE} comparison of how {DATE} then {DATE},1,24,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041666666666666664,0.0,1.040095111,18.9,3722.2805,5,0.347039262,5.11864,2008-May-06,CHD

Okay Thanks And then the other question for Becky I was wondering I think you said that the loan loss provisions were up {MONEY} from to Is that right,5,29,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06896551724137931,2.548669364,18.21,53635.53321,4,0.7063667020000001,0.8298399999999999,2008-May-07,DVN
Got it And then the second question is just on the M&A front you 've said that you are looking at acquisitions for quite actively for {DATE} and you 've made your first material acquisition Are you still active in looking at further traditional acquisitions right now and could you give us some color on how rich the pipeline is,5,60,1,0.0,0.016666666666666666,0.016666666666666666,0.0,0.016666666666666666,1.992042676,18.21,14095.00722,11,0.567849516,0.09802,2008-May-07,MMC
Okay Thanks And then you also just mentioned a moment ago with the solar project the decision between the less efficient thin film and the other technology Where do you stand on that {DATE},4,34,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.029411764705882353,0.0,1.994482388,18.21,6738.3755,11,0.350751737,0.24397,2008-May-07,VTR
Yes Okay a quickie on back to that comp issue at the IB Just what kind of magnitude are we talking in terms of stock cash split Is that something that you 'd be willing to share in terms of where we came from which is where we are and I 'm assuming that 's more of an ongoing issue as opposed to a {CARDINAL} time event {DATE},5,68,1,0.0,0.0,0.014705882352941176,0.0,0.014705882352941176,1.994482388,18.21,6738.3755,11,0.350751737,0.24397,2008-May-07,VTR
Just following up on the topic of M&A and more broadly capital allocation can you talk about how you view stock buybacks versus M&A opportunities {DATE},1,26,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.038461538461538464,0.0,1.994482388,18.21,6738.3755,11,0.350751737,0.24397,2008-May-07,VTR
Helpful Then a follow up for Karl Heinz looking at your guidance for the international business as a whole to be consistent with corporate growth and yet {PERCENT} growth in Asia that implies declines in Europe are you seeing declines in Europe in other brands besides the Jeanswear or is is that exclusive to the Jeanswear business,2,57,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.017543859649122806,0.03508771929824561,1.994482388,18.21,6738.3755,11,0.350751737,0.24397,2008-May-07,VTR
Okay And then the {CARDINAL} guidance range {MONEY} to {MONEY} Now that assumes normal weather So is the range essentially going to be driven by outcome of rate cases or where else would you see the Delta there,5,38,1,0.0,0.0,0.02631578947368421,0.0,0.0,1.994482388,18.21,6738.3755,11,0.350751737,0.24397,2008-May-07,VTR
Okay So it sounds like your acquisition strategy would be somewhat tactical in that regard going forward more like what we 've seen in {DATE} rather than a TALX kind of transaction,2,32,1,0.0,0.03125,0.03125,0.0,0.0,3.426100129,18.21,4506.694979999998,12,0.509544175,1.7889099999999998,2008-May-07,PWR
Okay Just last question on the range of guidance that 's left for the rest of {DATE} any key drivers other than maybe acquisitions that would produce kind of the high or the low end of the range,2,38,1,0.0,0.02631578947368421,0.02631578947368421,0.0,0.02631578947368421,3.426100129,18.21,4506.694979999998,12,0.509544175,1.7889099999999998,2008-May-07,PWR
Okay And then last question I appreciate that you guys do n't have significant large contracts up for renewal over {DATE} But I had understood at least that maybe an opportunity for you guys was that the Horizon contract which you 're not in now was up for grabs and that we might even hear something by {DATE} I personally have n't heard anything Have you guys heard any update on that Any thoughts,7,74,1,0.0,0.02702702702702703,0.02702702702702703,0.013513513513513514,0.013513513513513514,3.426100129,18.21,4506.694979999998,12,0.509544175,1.7889099999999998,2008-May-07,PWR
How much of that is related to weather and how much is actually the underlying capacity declined,1,17,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058823529411764705,2.565795219,18.21,7527.050999999998,4,0.743053477,1.75545,2008-May-07,PXD
Got it So I know you do n't give {DATE} guidance so I just want to push around on that a little bit if I could just because you 're talking about increasing the OpEx but maybe not seeing some revenue until the back {DATE} I guess what that would suggest Mike is that we should expect OpEx probably as a percent of revenue to go up and if we 're modeling flattish revenue assuming street is in the ballpark on revenue then that could actually suggest all things equal that you might see EPS actually decline {MONEY} {MONEY} or so in {DATE} Is that logical thinking,5,107,1,0.0,0.056074766355140186,0.07476635514018691,0.0,0.009345794392523364,1.15372391,19.73,8099.95599,6,0.242066814,7.14974,2008-May-08,ATVI
Thanks for that Maggie Just as a follow on to that I think there is another number of for synergies out there of {MONEY} Are there any plans to give us visibility on how you might get there {DATE} in {DATE},3,41,1,0.0,0.024390243902439025,0.024390243902439025,0.0,0.0,2.292166937,19.73,7120.39842,6,0.182649554,0.62132,2008-May-08,VRSN
That 's very helpful Maybe a quick follow up for Mark and Mark I know you guys do n't guide individual components of revenue license and maintenance but given the guide which I assume would imply license revenue flat to down slightly sequentially have your assumptions for {DATE} {PERCENT} or better revenue growth changed from when you initially offered it or is it still progressing as you expected based off the initial guidance,2,73,1,0.0,0.0136986301369863,0.0410958904109589,0.0273972602739726,0.0,2.222377042,17.79,13668.4992,9,0.16072061199999998,0.33613000000000004,2008-May-13,TJX
Okay thanks So that upper {DATE} is probably more indicative of your long term goal still,2,16,1,0.0,0.0,0.0625,0.0,0.0,2.222377042,17.79,13668.4992,9,0.16072061199999998,0.33613000000000004,2008-May-13,TJX
Thanks And then you quote the {PERCENT} average renewal increase How does that compare to where the renewals were actually sent out,3,22,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.520584244,17.66,5508.27432,9,0.17716899100000005,1.65526,2008-May-15,URBN
Okay that 's great Just a follow up In light of the Walmart news {DATE} and even TJ Max {TIME} I 'm just wondering if you feel like you need to raise your wages for your associates to stay competitive Have you factored any of that into your guidance for {DATE},4,51,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0196078431372549,0.0,2.0478203,16.3,3284.11448,9,0.272235242,3.3881900000000003,2008-May-16,AAP
All right So you could potentially see a pickup in volumes with seasonality there which will help on the raw material and potentially currency headwinds,2,25,1,0.0,0.04,0.04,0.0,0.0,2.423689521,17.01,16548.99197,9,0.338964703,0.08703999999999999,2008-May-20,SPLS
That would be Markets They usually mess up Ciccarelli A couple questions here for you guys First is has there been any change or do you get any sense from any of your financing vendors on financing approvals We just see kind of what the banks are doing they 're starting to tighten up credit a little bit Has that been your experience or is that something that concerns you at all,6,72,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.027777777777777776,2.076091238,17.01,115154.0696,6,0.291952528,0.98888,2008-May-20,HPQ
Just to follow up Frank obviously in dropping Exubera you 're dropping a lot of costs in manufacturing and promotion so wo n't that be accretive,1,26,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.076091238,17.01,115154.0696,6,0.291952528,0.98888,2008-May-20,HPQ
The US is apparently benefiting from some trade down certainly the performance of your brands was great in {DATE} all things considered Do you think that 's happening internationally or is it just you are so underpenetrated relative to what your potential is,2,43,1,0.0,0.023255813953488372,0.023255813953488372,0.046511627906976744,0.0,2.076091238,17.01,115154.0696,6,0.291952528,0.98888,2008-May-20,HPQ
Thanks Can you just tell us for any of your brands do you have anything meaningfully different planned for the upcoming Holiday season in terms of marketing or in store events maybe relative to {DATE},2,35,1,0.0,0.02857142857142857,0.02857142857142857,0.0,0.0,2.50993276,18.05,1869.66992,9,1.080979299,0.05582,2008-May-23,FL
Hi you have made some comments regarding your cash flow I think you said working capital improved et cetera can you just tell us what the actual cash flow from operations number is and then I have a second question regarding M A. I think Gary you had said that you 're focused on what you can control but prior to the financial crisis I think you had talked a lot about trying to make some acquisitions Is the constraint right now getting funding or has your appetite for acquisitions actually diminished,5,92,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.010869565217391304,0.03260869565217391,2.50993276,18.05,1869.66992,9,1.080979299,0.05582,2008-May-23,FL
Just on traditional M&A whether or not you think that that related activity might pick whether or not you have any interest,1,22,1,0.0,0.045454545454545456,0.045454545454545456,0.0,0.0,2.50993276,18.05,1869.66992,9,1.080979299,0.05582,2008-May-23,FL
Just wondered if you could discuss your own acquisition outlook Are there any particular areas that the Company is in need of of filling holes,2,25,1,0.0,0.04,0.04,0.0,0.0,2.361066526,19.64,3611.2635,9,0.416320753,15.484229999999998,2008-May-28,RL
First question just wanted to dig in a little bit more Don on your comments regarding sales trends in {DATE} and how you 're thinking about the spring Given that sales pace is still down {DATE} obviously with some of the shorter term comps and recent gyrations {DATE} with the mortgage environment in terms of your expectations you 're obviously looking forward as you said to a strong {DATE} But as that comps against {DATE} where it was also a very strong selling season are you thinking more that you 'd be happy matching on a sales per community basis the results of {DATE} and that would certainly qualify as a strong season Or are you actually looking for {DATE} improvement on a sales pace basis,4,126,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03968253968253968,0.015873015873015872,3.161443254,19.64,3043.03752,9,0.393021069,3.27579,2008-May-28,DLTR
Just a question on when you say you have balance sheet capacity is that also looking out long term through {DATE} Or is that more over {DATE},2,27,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037037037037037035,2.448923216,22.24,21819.77629,12,0.562188534,2.34399,2008-Jun-19,CCL
Last question is just across your {CARDINAL} segments where do you still have the most immediate opportunity for RCI,1,19,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05263157894736842,0.05263157894736842,2.448923216,22.24,21819.77629,12,0.562188534,2.34399,2008-Jun-19,CCL
And a one word answer will be fine on this one But in light of the cost reductions that you 've been able to achieve the price increases and even modest improvement in capacity utilization in {CARDINAL} should we be considering at or at or above break even levels even in our probability distribution for what we should be thinking for {CARDINAL},2,62,1,0.0,0.0,0.016129032258064516,0.04838709677419355,0.016129032258064516,2.448923216,22.24,21819.77629,12,0.562188534,2.34399,2008-Jun-19,CCL
Just lastly for clarification is there anything in your {CARDINAL} outlook that encompasses a business or product effect from Apollo or is it still going to be in the development phase and market development phase throughout {DATE},1,37,1,0.0,0.0,0.02702702702702703,0.0,0.0,2.77536619,22.42,74517.33702,5,0.197183912,1.09181,2008-Jun-25,MON
In general terms Steve could you talk about what categories in your portfolio tend to be lower margin versus higher margin For example the step up and in the vet business would that have been a driver down of gross profit,2,41,1,0.0,0.024390243902439025,0.024390243902439025,0.0,0.0,1.991783837,22.42,114484.5,6,0.206102392,3.22922,2008-Jun-25,ORCL

And any comment on lending cap rate ranges,1,8,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.761520478,28.48,187156.1307,10,0.236546242,2.78908,2008-Jul-15,JNJ
Okay Just {CARDINAL} last question can you talk about what your gift card trends were over {DATE},2,17,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058823529411764705,0.761520478,28.48,187156.1307,10,0.236546242,2.78908,2008-Jul-15,JNJ
How big a piece of the business has that become for you,1,12,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.954474898,28.48,24603.978,3,0.191651894,0.9303,2008-Jul-15,KMB
Wondering with the improved costs you 're seeing in the Fayetteville are you seeing any improvements in the number of wells You 've had some mechanical difficulties with some wells are you seeing improvements there in terms of the percentage of wells that you 're running into problems,2,48,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0625,0.041666666666666664,0.954474898,28.48,24603.978,3,0.191651894,0.9303,2008-Jul-15,KMB

Got it So bottom line then in reading into this answer and last one is of the {MONEY} of unrealized loss there might be a little bleed in but you still think there 's a decent liquidity component to the marks,2,41,1,0.0,0.024390243902439025,0.024390243902439025,0.0,0.024390243902439025,1.799252602,28.48,7608.61332,1,0.487253776,1.64095,2008-Jul-15,VFC

On the bankruptcy front and the lease termination front and that sort of side of the equation it seems that things are pretty good I guess Rick how would you characterize the outlook for lost tenants over the next I do n't know {DATE},2,44,1,0.0,0.0,0.022727272727272728,0.022727272727272728,0.06818181818181818,2.600659092,28.54,6057.81,12,0.5995438120000001,0.0,2008-Jul-16,HST
Just curious on the wind resource update that you talked about And I think you mentioned a number of {PERCENT} Is that on the new basis so therefore not comparable with I think it was {PERCENT} in {DATE} or is that,4,41,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.375691409,28.54,23428.083,12,0.824011397,0.10295,2008-Jul-16,CSX
A quick question I just want to confirm I believe you guys said in the past that there is when we look at the revenue decline from the sales and the MSR and the LAS business versus the corresponding reduction in expenses we should kind of count on a lag on that front is that right,2,56,1,0.0,0.0,0.017857142857142856,0.0,0.05357142857142857,1.459850116,28.54,89279.6736,10,0.204286587,6.19122,2008-Jul-16,ABT

Okay And then is there a sense that the dental and vision are those the products that at least in the early stages seem to be leading the exchanges at least in the conversations you guys are having with some of those brokers,1,43,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.023255813953488372,0.0,2.752099404,25.1,21081.56265,11,0.489591129,2.25386,2008-Jul-17,BLK

Good {TIME} I just had {CARDINAL} question just a follow up to Tayo 's question earlier on the deceleration in the US SHOP portfolio Based on the performance that you have seen here in {DATE} so far do you expect that deceleration to continue here into {DATE} and do you care to comment on the possibility for re acceleration into {DATE},3,61,1,0.0,0.0,0.01639344262295082,0.01639344262295082,0.03278688524590164,4.297907011,25.1,13397.678,11,0.7543996740000001,0.0916,2008-Jul-17,BBT
Jim I just had some what I hope are simple questions on page {CARDINAL} on the rate case proposed decision On the left hand column there the bottom bullet there 's the {MONEY} pole loading capital spending reduction and then in the parenthetical below that it says {MONEY} capital expenditure reduction What is the difference,3,55,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01818181818181818,3.566215492,25.1,21090.0456,3,0.31974403,2.3186,2008-Jul-17,NUE
And on Transportation Systems just more color again around given all the program wins and all of the activity there what on the cost side can you provide some more color about what 's going to be different {DATE} in terms of the cost structure of the Company to handle this massive downturn,1,53,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.018867924528301886,3.566215492,25.1,21090.0456,3,0.31974403,2.3186,2008-Jul-17,NUE
Fair enough Last question as you shut down crackers what should we expect in terms of impact to your contract ethylene sales and PCI profitability,2,25,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04,0.08,2.27017879,25.1,17571.10698,3,0.386754815,0.12993,2008-Jul-17,JCI^I16
Back to Home for {CARDINAL} last question Are you seeing unusual costs inflation pressure there in that business maybe in the hard to get side versus,2,26,1,0.0,0.038461538461538464,0.07692307692307693,0.0,0.038461538461538464,1.538780703,25.1,24335.5021,3,0.338671991,1.98328,2008-Jul-17,ITW
And then just {CARDINAL} last question I guess it 's strategic albeit maybe a little bit early There 's obviously a fair amount of speculation that the runup in cotton may be transient in nature and that would most directly impact {DATE} deliveries for Apparel I 'm just wondering how you would think about the second {CARDINAL} should cotton persist in that {MONEY} to {MONEY} range if you 'd be willing to cede some portion to gain market share in the back {CARDINAL} Or would you look to correct it through pricing action,5,93,1,0.0,0.021505376344086023,0.03225806451612903,0.010752688172043012,0.021505376344086023,1.609093395,25.1,59472.49644,3,0.283671692,0.56413,2008-Jul-17,UTX
Okay I guess just having observed the Company for a long time now it seems that when it comes to the soup advertising or promotion the Company over {DATE} just has tried like advertising in {DATE} and tried to get boost the business in a non seasonally important part and then obviously you 've changed what happened {DATE} But I guess is it maybe it 's a tough question to answer but is it really about the timing of the advertising or promotion I mean is n't it at {DATE} just about the quality of the soup during the height of the soup season and that 's really what 's going to make a difference and not what seems like a never ending shift as to what the Company thinks is the right time or not the right time to advertise or promote the product,7,145,1,0.006896551724137931,0.006896551724137931,0.020689655172413793,0.006896551724137931,0.006896551724137931,1.609093395,25.1,59472.49644,3,0.283671692,0.56413,2008-Jul-17,UTX

Good {TIME} gentlemen Given the success that you 're demonstrating in the common plan I wonder if you 'd consider replacing since you took it out of your put back slide with one that tracks your land and vertical costs And if you would perhaps comment on that on a year over year sequential basis how the land is changing given that you are highlighting other factors like lot premiums etc But I think the core vertical versus land if you 'd comment on your opinion about talking about that,4,90,1,0.0,0.011111111111111112,0.011111111111111112,0.022222222222222223,0.0,1.581765884,25.1,17276.969569999994,9,0.062261968,3.4917,2008-Jul-17,YUM
Good {TIME} Thanks Wanted to talk a little bit about restructuring given heightened competition domestically I do n't it does n't sound like that 's going to end anytime soon So is there a need to do something a little bit more drastic in terms of cost cutting more restructuring in order to fund the incremental promotion incremental activity that needs to be done to defend your share within your categories,7,71,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.014084507042253521,0.056338028169014086,2.342752261,25.01,115466.9599,4,0.12648193800000002,1.49913,2008-Jul-18,SLB
Then just a couple of housekeeping questions On your guidance for a {PERCENT} {PERCENT} comp store sales gain is it reasonable to assume that there 's about a point benefit from {DATE} shift since you are typically guiding {CARDINAL} to or do you think it 's more than that,2,49,1,0.0,0.0,0.02040816326530612,0.04081632653061224,0.02040816326530612,2.342752261,25.01,115466.9599,4,0.12648193800000002,1.49913,2008-Jul-18,SLB
And then just {CARDINAL} quick follow up You made a comment on your renewals being {PERCENT} {DATE} or {DATE} Is that mostly customers upgrading to the Advanced Platform and taking on a higher ASP or it is there a lot of extra buildout and you know JBoss is one that you have mentioned going on there,3,56,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.342752261,25.01,115466.9599,4,0.12648193800000002,1.49913,2008-Jul-18,SLB

Just a follow up for Bob In {DATE} soup margins or Soup Sauces and Beverages margins were down {CARDINAL} basis points {DATE} In {DATE} they are down {CARDINAL} basis points although as you said there was no price realization So I am just trying to understand what explains that Is it just a scale issue that sales were down in {DATE} and now you have better sales What else is going on You are spending more the pricing is flat yet the margin trend it is a lot better I am just trying to get a sense of what explains that,8,101,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.019801980198019802,0.0,4.442603374,24.05,125329.1367,11,0.777654022,1.18737,2008-Jul-21,BAC
And are you seeing truck lanes {DATE} that are you know shippers are more willing to take the intermodal route because of the pricing because of fuel and what that is doing to the overall cost structure versus maybe {DATE},1,40,1,0.0,0.025,0.025,0.0,0.0,4.442603374,24.05,125329.1367,11,0.777654022,1.18737,2008-Jul-21,BAC
Okay And your favorite question {DATE} was there any sort of trend throughout the quarter progression that we should be aware of,2,22,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045454545454545456,0.045454545454545456,4.442603374,24.05,125329.1367,11,0.777654022,1.18737,2008-Jul-21,BAC
Okay And of those related to XenApp were any of those carry over from any pushouts you got from,2,19,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.442603374,24.05,125329.1367,11,0.777654022,1.18737,2008-Jul-21,BAC
So my impression the last time we spoke was that you described things I think as rational You had good mark up And I guess my take away is it might have even been a little bit slightly more favorable than normal Can you I guess comment on that and current trends would you say it 's average or is it similar to what we have seen during {DATE},4,69,1,0.0,0.014492753623188406,0.014492753623188406,0.028985507246376812,0.0,4.442603374,24.05,125329.1367,11,0.777654022,1.18737,2008-Jul-21,BAC
But Jim fair to say or Ted for that matter that you do expect to spend some money on compliance across the fleet that some of those units will certainly be running if not all of them at {DATE},1,39,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.916196234,24.05,5366.6076,3,0.269883356,3.6893,2008-Jul-21,AME
Earl can you comment on how you 're seeing the EMEA business right now There 's still a lot of instability over there Have you seen any uptick from the lows you saw {DATE},3,34,1,0.0,0.0,0.029411764705882353,0.0,0.029411764705882353,1.932309114,24.05,3548.8032,5,0.35452223200000005,0.9942,2008-Jul-21,ALB
The reception does n't seem so great here {DATE} I think in that last question we were talking around some of your biggest customers and we cold ask a lot about Walgreens and CVS Could you just remind us are they up for renewal {DATE} And is there anything in your fiscal {CARDINAL} guidance that would account for any assumptions for any changes there,4,64,1,0.0,0.015625,0.03125,0.015625,0.015625,1.932309114,24.05,3548.8032,5,0.35452223200000005,0.9942,2008-Jul-21,ALB
Okay and just {CARDINAL} last one for me Just on the demand environment itself are you seeing any shifts in market share win rates in any which way,2,28,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03571428571428571,0.0,1.932309114,24.05,3548.8032,5,0.35452223200000005,0.9942,2008-Jul-21,ALB
Hi guys {CARDINAL} questions {CARDINAL} as you look ahead beyond the pending merger do you think are there any non core assets in your current portfolio that you perhaps would be open to divest,3,34,1,0.0,0.029411764705882353,0.058823529411764705,0.0,0.058823529411764705,2.344660499,24.05,146302.4125,6,0.11317161,2.6432,2008-Jul-21,AAPL
And a follow up if I might On the business that you guys acquired have you done anything different in terms of their go to market or sourcing any of the logistics they do the SAPs or is that pretty much running as it was on its own prior to your acquisition,2,52,1,0.0,0.019230769230769232,0.019230769230769232,0.0,0.0,2.344660499,24.05,146302.4125,6,0.11317161,2.6432,2008-Jul-21,AAPL
{CARDINAL} questions First on online and I guess specifically Amazon it seems to continue to infringe on Target 's everyday business and increasingly the consumable category so I guess the question is {CARDINAL} fold Do you feel like that you 're making good progress here on slowing the bleed of sales And then secondly have you seen any impact from the recent changes in your trends in markets where Amazon is now being forced to collect some sales tax online,6,80,1,0.0,0.0,0.0125,0.025,0.0625,2.734241447,23.05,6402.39709,6,0.16782229899999998,2.5950900000000003,2008-Jul-22,ROK
Let me ask you with the performance we 're seeing here it 's really being driven as you outlined by the base business that you 're taking share and obviously juggling stents and S ICD and a couple of other businesses going well But these are challenging core markets underneath that So do you feel the need to add more pipeline assets Obviously this is {DATE} but you are betting on markets that are n't growing and I know you prefer to better markets that are growing So given the questions on layer WATCHMAN and some of the pipeline stuff do you want to add more pipeline to the portfolio {DATE},5,111,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.009009009009009009,0.018018018018018018,2.666461704,23.05,15522.141119999998,2,0.250645574,0.7245699999999999,2008-Jul-22,PCAR
Okay but just to clarify it sounds like we should expect excluding that to benefit core sales over the balance of {DATE} but probably not as much as we saw in {DATE} Is that fair,2,35,1,0.0,0.0,0.02857142857142857,0.02857142857142857,0.0,2.666461704,23.05,15522.141119999998,2,0.250645574,0.7245699999999999,2008-Jul-22,PCAR
And finally is your technology customer also a good supplies customer or do you find it 's a different customer from the ones that are buying supplies in your store,1,30,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03333333333333333,0.0,1.460662854,23.05,13555.096,12,0.277908233,0.10056,2008-Jul-22,OMC
Great that 's all very helpful So just on that I 'm assuming the {DATE} hedge position going from {CARDINAL} is that really kind of balancing some of the locked in losses that you have in {DATE},2,37,1,0.0,0.0,0.02702702702702703,0.02702702702702703,0.02702702702702703,1.460662854,23.05,13555.096,12,0.277908233,0.10056,2008-Jul-22,OMC
Great If I can just follow up on that with regards to some of the assignments that you 're getting can you characterize them in terms of number of placements per account in terms of how that 's changed relative to the recent past,2,44,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.022727272727272728,0.0,2.078835909,23.05,4381.83212,1,1.046431076,0.24675,2008-Jul-22,MHK
Great thank you Not to beat a dead horse but {PERCENT} that you 've talked about on the impact from Bombardier Kelly is that a firmed up number or is that your best guess at this point Do actually know how far Bombardier is going down on global and what they 're thinking for C Series {DATE},3,57,1,0.017543859649122806,0.0,0.0,0.03508771929824561,0.0,1.317266161,23.05,41141.10548,3,0.227528809,6.8693300000000015,2008-Jul-22,LMT

I 'm sorry just to be clear So the contract terms you had on the waste fee power fees renewables none of that 's changed It 's just the ability to get it into commercialization And I guess it 's {DATE} behind Is that an indictment of the technology or is there some other issue at work,5,57,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.017543859649122806,4.499445931,23.05,11986.3833,11,0.806189327,6.10082,2008-Jul-22,STI
Sure Sorry Was wondering what your thought is in terms of pricing strategy going forward In the past you 've talked a lot about how you 're not going to sacrifice pricing or margins enough just to capture volume Was wondering if you would in this environment where you see orders coming down and certainly look at what 's happening in the market {DATE} if it does n't improve for awhile do you think what do you think about promotion and more activity in order to stem some of the volume decline,5,92,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.010869565217391304,0.021739130434782608,2.704057167,23.05,736.44709,11,0.34637766299999995,0.99908,2008-Jul-22,CNC
And then finally you did n't really comment at all on promotional financing and the overall contribution of the credit card business Can you comment on that at all,2,29,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.202566313,23.05,9688.80856,12,0.112737889,3.5846400000000003,2008-Jul-22,CHRW
And secondly you guys have pretty good loyalty card data If you look at where you 're getting your comp store growth from you sort of have a couple of buckets here the primary shopper 's buying more secondary maybe transitioning more to primary and then maybe a third bucket being totally new customers What do you is the bulk of it coming from primary spending more with you more share or are you picking up in the other {CARDINAL} areas as well,3,83,1,0.0,0.024096385542168676,0.024096385542168676,0.012048192771084338,0.0,1.998499527,23.05,20648.3604,10,1.002187439,1.27103,2008-Jul-22,BSX

Okay and then a quick follow up for John You 've nearly exhausted the amount of share repurchases that you 've indicated that you were going to do {DATE} How should we think about the back {CARDINAL} especially with the stock trading at the valuation that it is right now,3,50,1,0.0,0.02,0.02,0.0,0.0,2.171705024,23.05,19403.4799,10,0.359766036,2.46901,2008-Jul-22,BIIB
Maybe just one from me Doug going back to pharma when you think about your view there and what you are seeing out of those accounts does the growth outlook at this point include anything in the way of expectations for a budget flush in I guess to the extent you have a feel what 's the general thinking in terms of end of the year spending there,3,68,1,0.0,0.014705882352941176,0.014705882352941176,0.0,0.0,2.171705024,23.05,19403.4799,10,0.359766036,2.46901,2008-Jul-22,BIIB

Okay Thank you And then if we look at the new footprints obviously that was very good in {DATE} If we ex out the UAE contract would that have been more in line in terms of the percentage of bookings with respect to new footprints,4,45,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.022222222222222223,0.0,6.250016372999999,23.05,7733.1267,11,0.683696966,10.65095,2008-Jul-22,FITB
Okay On the other hand the number of new customers taking on maintenance has continued to slow {DATE} round The number of new signings has {CARDINAL} of {DATE} average So that would seems to be some indication of obviously weakness in the new license businesses but do you think that number of new signings new subscribers is going to continue to tail off significantly from here,4,66,1,0.0,0.0,0.015151515151515152,0.0,0.030303030303030304,1.827022224,23.05,3573.80325,10,0.320779521,1.85061,2008-Jul-22,EW
Okay That 's helpful With regards to the touch area you 've talked about inductive touch You 've talked about the touchscreens with the Hampshire Company How are you thinking in terms of as a percentage of overall growth that you 're getting from touch the inductive piece and the touchscreen Are those small or are those going to contribute in a major way to the overall touch growth,6,69,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.974203088,23.05,1959.90035,11,1.7290587469999998,1.78965,2008-Jul-22,ETFC
Okay And then {CARDINAL} more just on Tektronix How is the business from a profitability perspective running relative to where you ended {DATE},3,23,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043478260869565216,0.0,1.797633852,21.18,28791.10815,5,0.20988360600000006,1.3514,2008-Jul-23,PX
And can you just comment on where and what where you 're shipping to and how that those how you expect that market to transpire,1,25,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.176403723,21.18,2782.89444,9,0.433321343,0.22631,2008-Jul-23,ORLY
I guess sharp declines in test and measurements opens the door That could rebound quite quickly How did the book to build ratios look in that those businesses,3,28,1,0.0,0.03571428571428571,0.03571428571428571,0.03571428571428571,0.03571428571428571,2.26330435,21.18,24683.34595,12,0.844562849,5.85289,2008-Jul-23,NSC
Do you have maybe a percentage or a dollar value,1,10,1,0.0,0.1,0.1,0.0,0.0,1.89524628,21.18,3728.99968,12,0.230246776,6.7217,2008-Jul-23,RHI
Okay And then just in the I guess BD Medical business are you seeing any incremental pricing pressure or pressure on mix Some companies have talked about obviously times getting a little bit tougher on the hospital side Any shift back in terms of maybe not moving to a non safety device but maybe moving from a third Gen to a second Gen,4,63,1,0.0,0.031746031746031744,0.031746031746031744,0.0,0.0,2.547588159,21.18,5119.90505,2,0.630411936,1.01708,2008-Jul-23,WHR
Just as a follow up on that in terms of the capacity buying that you 're seeing is it distributed among a number of customers or is it concentrated between {CARDINAL} or {CARDINAL} customers,1,34,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.547588159,21.18,5119.90505,2,0.630411936,1.01708,2008-Jul-23,WHR
Okay so it continues to be the situation that the OEM compressor makers really are n't providing the most efficient machine that they could provide and you come along and make it that way Right,2,35,1,0.0,0.02857142857142857,0.02857142857142857,0.02857142857142857,0.0,2.021817831,21.18,27006.03598,11,0.7871353440000001,0.5092399999999999,2008-Jul-23,TRV
This is actually Patrick in for Bhavan Congrats on {DATE} and just a couple of quick questions for you We had heard of a reduction in partners within the European region Is that the case And if so could you provide a little bit more color on that,5,48,1,0.0,0.020833333333333332,0.020833333333333332,0.0,0.020833333333333332,2.021817831,21.18,27006.03598,11,0.7871353440000001,0.5092399999999999,2008-Jul-23,TRV
I apologize if you mentioned this but are you guys still targeting a constant revenues ratio {PERCENT},2,17,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.057490183,21.18,5809.98315,1,0.08649495800000001,0.78562,2008-Jul-23,HSY
Okay okay Then you also noted that you are gaining some traction with the larger builders Can you talk about maybe how you are achieving these gains And some of maybe in terms of the pricing are you seeing a lot of price sensitivity with these guys or how things are going there,4,53,1,0.0,0.03773584905660377,0.03773584905660377,0.05660377358490566,0.0,1.340569024,21.18,68147.58312000001,9,0.23657997100000006,7.091589999999999,2008-Jul-23,MCD
If I can fit {CARDINAL} other in You 've I 'm sure noticed that {CARDINAL} of your competitors had a pretty sizable engine strategy shift And I was wondering if you would expect any near term share gains or any other impact on just general market conditions because of that,3,50,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02,0.0,2.377693668,21.18,11955.636,11,0.334396587,0.34915,2008-Jul-23,BXP
Okay and then just to clarify what I think I just heard you say the starting point philosophy on share repurchases to cover what will be issued in shares as comp,1,31,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.149017003,21.18,9142.41893,10,0.196691829,3.31581,2008-Jul-23,BCR
So the last part that you just said there is the chance or you are looking into ways that perhaps the amounts above the {MONEY} could also be utilized beyond just international,1,32,1,0.0,0.0625,0.0625,0.0,0.0,2.7254662410000003,21.18,28949.85037,6,0.031060059,6.04537,2008-Jul-23,AMZN
{CARDINAL} quick ones First Matt you addressed the extra investment income from the acceleration on the mark on that sale The other property income that was {MONEY} was up considerably from the historic run rate Was there anything what was in there Was there {CARDINAL} time ish stuff or is that a new run rate for {DATE},5,57,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.80641344,21.18,15473.00808,9,0.421949072,3.5568699999999995,2008-Jul-23,MCK
Yes the M&A pipeline and given potential assets on the plastic side and the interest can you discuss your interest in those,1,22,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.502437552,21.18,55484.73374,8,0.281924556,3.65536,2008-Jul-23,EXC
Okay so probably some obviously nonrecurring things but it may be at least underlined there is some recurring things from your past investments I guess is that safe to say,4,30,1,0.0,0.03333333333333333,0.06666666666666667,0.0,0.0,2.23652669,21.18,3355.495,7,0.227425412,1.0306799999999998,2008-Jul-23,EQIX
Okay so you still have the comfort and the visibility to think that organic growth will further accelerate in {DATE},1,20,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.23652669,21.18,3355.495,7,0.227425412,1.0306799999999998,2008-Jul-23,EQIX
Question on Enbrel So I 'm looking at the math on slide {CARDINAL} and it seems to make some sense with respect to price making up the difference when you factor in inventory and units but just want to clarify Do you see and is it also possible that a {DATE} driver could be changes in rebates and discounts Is that a measurable impact at {DATE} especially {DATE},4,68,1,0.0,0.029411764705882353,0.04411764705882353,0.0,0.014705882352941176,2.75018733,21.31,9382.4852,11,0.553135354,0.4966100000000001,2008-Jul-24,IVZ
And as a follow up to that to what degree are you still doing reviews with your customers And is that are you still getting a top line benefit like it probably is not what you were getting but some kind of benefit from that process,2,46,1,0.0,0.0,0.021739130434782608,0.043478260869565216,0.0,1.217204555,21.31,7974.645,10,0.2662387,0.03991,2008-Jul-24,LH
Okay Thank you And then just a follow up question I know that you 've also stated a desire to be disciplined on the acquisition side Specifically in the security area are you beginning to see some of the valuations perhaps become a bit more reasonable,5,46,1,0.0,0.021739130434782608,0.021739130434782608,0.0,0.021739130434782608,1.217204555,21.31,7974.645,10,0.2662387,0.03991,2008-Jul-24,LH
Larry mentioned at {DATE} the pace of acquisitions would pick up in a tougher environment Are you thinking about doing a blend of smaller transactions or are you still keeping in mind larger transactions as the environment gets tougher into {CARDINAL},2,41,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.036939056,21.31,6850.896,4,0.676885475,0.7466,2008-Jul-24,NFX
Good {TIME} It 's actually Rob Hansen on for Nishu Just on the mortgage business in the release you mentioned that you had a positive shift in the mix of mortgage loans towards more profitable agency backed products I just wanted to see if you could provide some color on this Is there a significant difference in the profitability between FHA and conforming or am I just could you give some color on that,5,74,1,0.0,0.02702702702702703,0.02702702702702703,0.05405405405405406,0.0,3.036939056,21.31,6850.896,4,0.676885475,0.7466,2008-Jul-24,NFX
If we look at that impairment of {MONEY} could you give a little bit of color on that talk about was it some of the PUDs that were impaired or was it more of a tail,1,36,1,0.0,0.027777777777777776,0.027777777777777776,0.0,0.05555555555555555,2.311804457,21.31,5792.2638,6,0.175304187,0.08693,2008-Jul-24,MCHP
Makes a lot of sense And then Lee as you look through the line items different elements of cost of goods what do you see as kind of the biggest opportunities to provide an offset to the inflationary pressures on the cost side aside from the pricing,2,47,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02127659574468085,0.0,2.7503615710000004,21.31,5949.6285,6,0.146038649,1.14133,2008-Jul-24,FLIR
Okay And then just briefly on expenses in {DATE} it looks like excluding the UK charge G&A dropped Or actually it was lighter than what I expected What are the trends there and I think you mentioned marketing How sustainable would cost control be in G&A,6,46,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.021739130434782608,1.332424263,21.31,20892.0496,10,0.219878856,4.86155,2008-Jul-24,BDX
Do you go to the TRICARE contractors Could you go to DoD Could this be expanded to something kind of more macro for you Or is it going to be base by base forever,4,34,1,0.0,0.058823529411764705,0.058823529411764705,0.0,0.0,1.332424263,21.31,20892.0496,10,0.219878856,4.86155,2008-Jul-24,BDX
Great On the debt retirement Chris by our estimates you should get to that {PERCENT} range debt to capital ex ASCI by {DATE} Would that Does that mean that debt retirement should pretty much be complete by {DATE},3,38,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02631578947368421,0.0,1.393985648,21.31,25429.09707,11,0.743092531,0.35208,2008-Jul-24,ALL
Okay And with the {CARDINAL} basis point decline that we are seeing maybe more than that over {DATE} are you seeing that yet in expectations and pricing on assets Or is it more anticipated,4,34,1,0.0,0.029411764705882353,0.058823529411764705,0.0,0.029411764705882353,1.393985648,21.31,25429.09707,11,0.743092531,0.35208,2008-Jul-24,ALL
Thank you Spencer I 'm curious what impact lower gas prices have on the mind set of the storage consumer Have you seen any changes in your customers decision making patterns and have you made any specific operational adjustments as the price of gas has come down,3,47,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.393985648,21.31,25429.09707,11,0.743092531,0.35208,2008-Jul-24,ALL
Great If I could ask just {CARDINAL} followup when you think about capital I know you mentioned {DATE} buyback as a good run rate and if I run it through the model that seems to be that you guys are going to continue to be accreting capital and you 're about to enter your first year as a CCAR bank I guess the question I have is are you changing at all the way you 're thinking about your appetite to use your capital in a more strategic way I know historically you guys have done a lot of small deals and grown the business over time but is your appetite for some small asset acquisitions increasing at this point given your desire to leverage on the excess capital,7,129,1,0.0,0.007751937984496124,0.015503875968992248,0.015503875968992248,0.007751937984496124,2.299381465,21.31,39960.12284,12,0.782258687,13.16284,2008-Jul-24,UNP
Okay Kevin can you just give us a sense for what those provisioning times look like {DATE} versus {DATE} {DATE},1,20,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.823126282,21.31,7746.68103,6,0.34855819,3.47852,2008-Jul-24,WDC
Is there any opportunity to consolidate more acreage out there or is it pretty tough,1,15,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06666666666666667,0.0,3.636580587,21.31,10778.18247,12,0.163838235,1.05371,2008-Jul-24,WYNN
Bill it looks like that international sales grew {PERCENT} {CARDINAL} versus {CARDINAL} given that you went from {PERCENT} What 's the growth rate for {CARDINAL} that you have embedded in your sales forecast for international,2,35,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.393217944,21.31,8351.96076,4,0.301969949,1.51297,2008-Jul-24,RRC
And is kind of excess cash to do deals and also through averaging up {MONEY} even with the Cooke Bieler deal closed,1,22,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045454545454545456,1.797003396,21.31,3011.11173,3,0.494987141,1.86316,2008-Jul-24,SNA
But I mean did you guys receive a benefit just from running your plants at a higher utilization that debt was quantifiable,1,22,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045454545454545456,0.0,2.710287647,23.44,1654.88103,12,0.249278335,0.51799,2008-Jul-25,NFLX

When you take a look at {DATE} maybe you could give us a feel for in total what you are doing internally that can keep earnings on an up trend and given assuming foreign currency holds where it is now what type of volume or market demand back drop would you need to see to keep your earnings on the positive trend in {DATE} versus {DATE} Is there enough there internally and what may be new product wins that could off set the foreign currency and some other negative that you have,2,92,1,0.0,0.043478260869565216,0.05434782608695652,0.010869565217391304,0.010869565217391304,4.404773825,23.44,5317.22718,11,0.886667227,0.6784100000000001,2008-Jul-25,LM
Thank you The second question in terms of the variable annuities if we think about the lower base of assets and so we will have lower fees in {DATE} we are also having lower sales I am just wondering in terms of the actual cash flow or statutory earnings how does that change what is the delta there for {CARDINAL} versus {CARDINAL},3,62,1,0.0,0.0,0.016129032258064516,0.0,0.016129032258064516,1.6598315680000002,23.44,5060.4793,5,0.489414481,0.0,2008-Jul-25,EMN
The question on Gulfstream kind of a follow up to Cai 's Even within the large cabin mix the {CARDINAL} versus {CARDINAL} is n't the mix in {DATE} more favorable within the large cabin toward the {CARDINAL} in {DATE},2,39,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02564102564102564,0.02564102564102564,2.5773186530000003,22.91,20359.46837,11,0.145735192,0.51961,2008-Jul-28,SPG

But so it would be realistic for me to assume or for us to assume rather that there will be {MONEY} plus the {CARDINAL} asset that has already sold {DATE} because of those {MONEY} are already under contract right,1,39,1,0.0,0.0,0.05128205128205128,0.0,0.0,1.896888727,22.91,56993.44,10,0.363488475,2.2024,2008-Jul-28,AMGN
Just on the industry M&A just thinking are you seeing any evidence that people are more motivated by doing deals maybe in the second {CARDINAL} based on the thought that taxes will be impacting them in the future I mean do you expect maybe more motivated sellers and maybe a pickup in M&A,2,53,1,0.0,0.05660377358490566,0.05660377358490566,0.0,0.0,1.4206573059999998,24.23,2832.73865,10,0.57863375,3.71216,2008-Jul-29,UHS
Okay But am I right I guess let me just think about is the historical range anywhere from I always thought it was {PERCENT} of the total profits to {PERCENT} of the total profits of that business would be value added Is that the would that be a right range,5,50,1,0.02,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.513460796,24.23,18335.12112,11,0.701800958,1.50058,2008-Jul-29,HIG
Just timing on that as far as hearing from you guys on that will that be in {DATE} call Or could that come before What are you guys thinking,3,29,1,0.0,0.034482758620689655,0.034482758620689655,0.0,0.0,2.823341389,24.23,2498.41952,9,0.111655731,1.5538,2008-Jul-29,HBI

Good {TIME} guys Thanks for taking the question Nick I guess with your defense exposure you 're clearly not as exposed as some of the other players in the space but how are you guys going to handle the impact of sequestration when you give your {CARDINAL} outlook,3,48,1,0.020833333333333332,0.0,0.020833333333333332,0.020833333333333332,0.041666666666666664,2.2127549980000003,22.03,16477.02791,6,0.8022962779999999,7.69105,2008-Jul-30,SYMC

And is it safe to say that the guidance implies a strengthening commercial aftermarket as we go through the year Your commentary on {DATE} seem to imply that things strength and as we go through {DATE} How do you see that cadence playing out,3,44,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045454545454545456,0.0,3.070358363,23.49,6772.0543,4,0.743053477,0.30878,2008-Aug-05,PXD
Nice results guys Question on store volumes so in the press release and do the math the stores are doing {MONEY} a box If you just look at your mature store base which I 'm presuming is a bit higher than that is there a significant spread between some of the better performing stores and the lower performing stores,3,59,1,0.0,0.0,0.01694915254237288,0.01694915254237288,0.01694915254237288,1.33587564,21.14,13754.4715,8,0.765226172,0.33333,2008-Aug-06,PCG

Okay But you 're not considering starting to plan off of a lower number to just have a bit more comfort that you can hit this number Or is that at this stage not saying that by the sound of it,3,41,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.250442567,21.14,15009.7572,11,0.567849516,1.65215,2008-Aug-06,MMC

Understood And then shifting gears to packaged gases as you look at the {DATE} volume results for {DATE} and {DATE} do you see any nascent signs of an early cyclical pick up there or would it be premature to say that at this juncture,2,44,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.022727272727272728,2.583023741,21.14,6436.41096,11,0.350751737,1.7192,2008-Aug-06,VTR

Got it Then in terms of spec homes you have a stated goal I think of getting to {PERCENT} of the homes under construction being expected It was {PERCENT} {DATE} You have n't made a lot of progress I assume there are more optimistic goals going into {DATE} When will we start to see some dramatic progress towards that goal Not dramatic but material progress towards that goal Do you expect {DATE} or is it a multi year process,8,79,1,0.0,0.0,0.012658227848101266,0.05063291139240506,0.0,1.347257544,21.14,5091.39015,8,0.736672215,7.0560800000000015,2008-Aug-06,CNP
I got that part Peter but would you expect a similar trajectory over the course of {DATE} in a way and also the {PERCENT} where do you think that goes,1,30,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.282688876,20.23,18122.52309,8,0.446938725,0.38425,2008-Aug-07,WMB
Do you think some of the wells that you 're drilling could actually be exempt similar to what 's done in say Oklahoma and Texas,1,25,1,0.0,0.04,0.04,0.0,0.0,3.270621859,20.66,13539.62592,12,0.176004379,0.53888,2008-Aug-11,FLR
So just to clarify you are strongly committed to investment grade ratings And would you do what 's necessary to maintain those,2,22,1,0.045454545454545456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.270621859,20.66,13539.62592,12,0.176004379,0.53888,2008-Aug-11,FLR
Yes I mean obviously there is a lot of passion for sports and basketball in particular in China Just curious what your thoughts are on that as a market opportunity,2,30,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03333333333333333,0.0,1.555077644,20.66,17941.02719,9,0.238774797,3.3542,2008-Aug-11,SYY
Okay but in raising your guidance you 've taken all of that into account etc,1,15,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.136165943,21.17,8602.422840000001,6,0.205615622,0.26048000000000004,2008-Aug-13,NTAP
So is {CARDINAL} {PERCENT} in the cards then at some point,1,11,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.952479192,21.55,5691.96825,9,0.17716899100000005,2.60202,2008-Aug-14,URBN
Okay My follow up is unrelated But relative to consolidation opportunities in North America and it seems like in this up cycle we 're muted on margin expansion through competition particularly in pressure pumping But what is your appetite You mentioned {DATE} for some people to see a choke point So what is your appetite for consolidation for the sake of consolidation versus for technology gains North America specifically,6,69,1,0.0,0.0,0.014492753623188406,0.028985507246376812,0.0,3.171885599,21.55,14596.947569999998,9,0.450214381,2.84071,2008-Aug-14,KSS
And just to follow up on that the new product activity I guess the briefs that IFF is one that are launched that really is the best I guess most and that 's the biggest way IFF has gained market share right Is actually by launching those new briefs,3,49,1,0.02040816326530612,0.0,0.0,0.04081632653061224,0.0,3.171885599,21.55,14596.947569999998,9,0.450214381,2.84071,2008-Aug-14,KSS
So on a profitability level on a return level in terms of investment would these newer businesses get up on par with what you guys have done on the uniform rental business,1,32,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03125,0.0,3.252355028,21.55,6439.761,9,0.12986483599999998,0.77325,2008-Aug-14,JWN
Okay And then just Dave as you talk about cadence in {DATE} you 've {DATE} in but clearly based on your guidance more revenue in Can you walk a little bit through the mechanics of that,3,36,1,0.027777777777777776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.425171635,20.98,109992.1186,6,0.291952528,2.92235,2008-Aug-19,HPQ
More a strategic question for Moshe Your foundries Samsung and UMC are they strategic partners or are you going to hold with them for the next node beyond Are you considering using perhaps DSMC What 's the foundry strategy going forward,5,41,1,0.0,0.024390243902439025,0.024390243902439025,0.0,0.024390243902439025,2.040025933,21.28,5045.52916,9,0.268502246,0.38519,2008-Aug-20,ROST
Got it With the levels you have does that increase You guys have always been pretty active on the M&A front prudently but active does it increase your appetite at all just knowing you have that the kind of cash that you on the balance sheet to go out and do something,3,52,1,0.019230769230769232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.988795865,20.42,1853.22235,1,0.544735348,0.96014,2008-Aug-21,PVH

My understanding is that you elected to take Maytag out of Best Buy I 'm just wondering if there 's any major changes going on in terms brand strategy with Maytag Is there a market share delta there that we should be talking about,3,44,1,0.022727272727272728,0.0,0.0,0.022727272727272728,0.0,1.881039854,20.42,9784.458,6,0.235117887,0.11363,2008-Aug-21,INTU
Hi thanks a lot Good {TIME} Just maybe a follow up to Brian 's question on the PFS AUM It looks like it only went up {PERCENT} and other AUM and AUC went up like mostly {PERCENT} So is all of that difference due to that {CARDINAL} client moving over to Institutional or are there other factors as well that we should think about Aside from that did you have inflows to PFS,6,73,1,0.0,0.0136986301369863,0.0136986301369863,0.0136986301369863,0.0136986301369863,3.266511257,19.82,2365.28288,9,1.080979299,2.02117,2008-Aug-22,FL
Just wanted to ask a question on condensed There have been some issues I think with excess capacity on the private label side in that business I am just wondering when you think about that in the context of the price increases that you are taking for {DATE} are you at all concerned that the price gaps in that part of the business are going to widen in {DATE},3,69,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.028985507246376812,3.266511257,19.82,2365.28288,9,1.080979299,2.02117,2008-Aug-22,FL
Then just {CARDINAL} quick question for Mike You 're guiding first quarter operating profit to drop what {PERCENT} Is the increase in the incentive comp is that the key reason for that decline,3,33,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06060606060606061,3.266511257,19.82,2365.28288,9,1.080979299,2.02117,2008-Aug-22,FL

Thank you very much and congratulations It sounds like that you are indeed building in no return of the China subsidy into your outlook which I think is a positive Under the premise of if the China subsidy were could to come back do you have the capacity to ramp production And if so what is a typical lead time for you to pour the glass get it into the channel for then it to make it onto the shelves or sell into the local Chinese citizen if the subsidy were to return,4,93,1,0.0,0.010752688172043012,0.010752688172043012,0.010752688172043012,0.0,2.502347006,21.99,8413.86636,11,0.13854660800000002,1.16925,2008-Sep-03,HRB
Okay so you 've got {MONEY} And if I understand your comments right you seem to imply that it would be difficult to get to the low end so the {PERCENT} CAGR over {DATE} given I guess a little higher base than the coal headwind I mean is that correct,3,50,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02,1.431708541,24.52,13961.64644,1,0.129099209,0.55071,2008-Sep-11,CPB
That makes sense A quick follow up on the comments you guys have made on the Latin route here A lot of the growth at least internationally is focused on LATAM It seems like your unit revenue is stronger than the industry in general Is that as a result of the joint ventures Is it just kind of where you 're focused on I 'm just kind of curious because a lot of growth is coming there I guess I worry about if there 's softness there what happens,8,89,1,0.0,0.0,0.011235955056179775,0.011235955056179775,0.011235955056179775,1.431708541,24.52,13961.64644,1,0.129099209,0.55071,2008-Sep-11,CPB

I was looking at the {DATE} drilling program It looks like the incremental horizontal rigs from the current level are going to be primarily in the Midland Basin And you all obviously had a really big uptick in your {DATE} rates in the Midland {DATE} I 'm just curious if that rig allocation is that different than you had envisioned like {DATE} Or was that kind of was always the plan,5,71,1,0.014084507042253521,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.333574154,31.7,18001.341,9,0.253922091,3.06679,2008-Sep-16,BBY
Great Thanks Just wondering about the {DATE} trend I think some others have talked about the trend in DC for {DATE} Seems there was a sufficient uptick in {DATE} that 's helping a lot of the numbers Can you quantify what you 're seeing in DC relative to the other markets for {DATE},6,53,1,0.0,0.0,0.018867924528301886,0.018867924528301886,0.0,2.238383949,31.7,20238.568,6,0.199297731,7.079110000000001,2008-Sep-16,ADBE
Good {TIME} I actually wanted to follow up on that last comment I know you have highlighted the {CARDINAL} or {CARDINAL} point impact from the Bombardier products and you lumped them all together I 'm wondering if you had assumed a slower rollout of the global when you were talking about globals If that entry into service is delayed is that further headwind or is there not much in terms of ship sets {DATE},5,74,1,0.0,0.0,0.013513513513513514,0.013513513513513514,0.02702702702702703,3.903190845,36.22,24300.80674,12,0.562188534,6.05989,2008-Sep-18,CCL
Are you all continuing to block up acreage I know you have a lot of contiguous positions already Are you limited yet at this point on how long of you know laterals you can drill out,3,36,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.10403295,36.22,93295.6898,6,0.206102392,3.23678,2008-Sep-18,ORCL
Just {CARDINAL} question on the outperformance relative to the peers on a same store NOI basis It 's been pretty substantial {DATE} I 'm wondering what do you guys think the driver of that is I know part of it can be how you guys determine the same store pool relative to the peers but what else would you attribute your outperformance to,4,63,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.015873015873015872,2.10403295,36.22,93295.6898,6,0.206102392,3.23678,2008-Sep-18,ORCL
And if I 'm not mistaken {DATE} you had some issues with garlic and with the news {DATE} on China restricting their exports of garlic to the U.S. are you an importer at this point of Chinese garlic And is that going to be a big issue for you,2,49,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02040816326530612,1.854983427,36.22,4846.43536,1,0.524209138,1.52128,2008-Sep-18,CTAS
My first question is about SCP Can you talk about what the capacity situation is there and whether you think SCP can keep up with the growth in capacity from this main customers of Samsung and LG over in Korea,2,40,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.025,1.982799761,32.07,8279.398737000001,9,0.028079075,0.41616,2008-Sep-22,AZO
On the {MONEY} increase in the budget would you say {DATE} of that is just the increase in service costs and labor costs,1,23,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.982799761,32.07,8279.398737000001,9,0.028079075,0.41616,2008-Sep-22,AZO
Okay Very helpful Final question from me very big picture {DATE} we tend to ask just updates on the capital allocation side and given credit playing out as expected the balance sheet kind of getting where you would expect it to be the strong cash that you 're generating could you talk a little bit about how you think of the dividend policy buybacks as well as opportunities on the acquisition side,3,72,1,0.0,0.013888888888888888,0.013888888888888888,0.027777777777777776,0.013888888888888888,1.982799761,32.07,8279.398737000001,9,0.028079075,0.41616,2008-Sep-22,AZO
Okay And then a specific question on the condensates being the theme so far with this call but say you look at your sort of more mid continent refineries the Ardmore and McKee as you look at the crude that 's coming into those refineries presume say it 's a WTI mix a lot of refiners are starting to complain that WTI is n't the same WTI it used to be because obviously condensates are being spiked into it Do you have any color on how the sort of gravity of that WTI has changed over time or where we are against the {CARDINAL} API spec,3,106,1,0.0,0.0,0.009433962264150943,0.0,0.02830188679245283,3.752532156000001,32.07,3636.171,9,0.370952659,1.03493,2008-Sep-22,KMX
Got it And then maybe last one just Mike jumping back to the balance sheet you guys have obviously done a lot of work good job in addressing the maturity profile With the tapping of the institutional debt market {DATE} as you look out at the curve you do still have some towers {DATE} I guess still stands out to me when I factor in the preferred securities that you guys have as well Is that should we expect Pitney to be back in institutional market maybe on a more consistent basis going forward as you look to address the maturity profile,4,102,1,0.0,0.0196078431372549,0.0196078431372549,0.00980392156862745,0.0,3.752532156000001,32.07,3636.171,9,0.370952659,1.03493,2008-Sep-22,KMX
And then I guess the last question just really more from a qualitative perspective when you think about the aluminum premium that you are paying in Europe that 's something that I would imagine was n't anticipated when you did your contracts Because it seems like that we have seen contracts in Europe as well as North America kind of have as a precondition almost or that volatility in aluminum is borne by the customer and yet here that is not occurring So why would there not be a change in the contracts just to keep that rule of thumb that we have been seeing for {DATE},3,107,1,0.0,0.009345794392523364,0.037383177570093455,0.0,0.018691588785046728,3.752532156000001,32.07,3636.171,9,0.370952659,1.03493,2008-Sep-22,KMX

Okay Maybe let me ask {CARDINAL} more on pricing Given what you are seeing-- you have talked previously about expectations of {PERCENT} You have tended to be you know less aggressive at least in commentary than many of your peers Where wha do you see now for {DATE} are you seeing clients backing off of price increases are you seeing any ask for concessions What are you seeing competitors doing,6,70,1,0.0,0.014285714285714285,0.014285714285714285,0.0,0.0,1.887153903,35.19,11653.6785,12,0.096845875,0.0,2008-Sep-25,PAYX
Thanks Jim {CARDINAL} questions a little bit unrelated one on the high level end thinking about your Latin American business A how do do you think about it in terms of potential whether its core or not core to you especially given some of the discussion around either repatriation of capital from overseas subsidiaries to U.S. holding companies or at least lending from overseas subsidiaries to U.S. holding companies,4,69,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.014492753623188406,2.286851092,39.81,3517.89701,12,0.31959369,4.24475,2008-Oct-02,GPN

Hi thanks Just within the office and consumer products category and I 'm sorry if I missed this but the organic rate of decline the improvement there from {DATE} I think it was down {PERCENT} to down {PERCENT} was that sequential improvement strictly related to the retail and the back to school level comments that you made with the commercial purchase activity being down the same amount Can you speak to the mix there a bit,4,76,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02631578947368421,0.02631578947368421,3.3427115689999995,54.99,94498.38,6,0.278341758,0.91056,2008-Oct-14,INTC
If I could just ask {CARDINAL} last question on your gross margin given the business as you know is there variability in {DATE} on how we should think about modeling for {DATE} Because {DATE} are n't {DATE} rate or are they,2,41,1,0.0,0.024390243902439025,0.04878048780487805,0.0,0.024390243902439025,7.442099745,55.13,24475.79412,11,0.360227828,1.16022,2008-Oct-15,STT
Okay thank you {CARDINAL} final question Can you give us an update on where you think AT&T is with its network improvement plans and are you still comfortable that the performance of the network will be up to par {DATE},3,40,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.025,0.025,7.442099745,55.13,24475.79412,11,0.360227828,1.16022,2008-Oct-15,STT
Right Juan do you think I guess this kind of ties back to Chris When you look out to {CARDINAL} do you need to stay in that range in {CARDINAL} Or can it even go outside that range and you would feel comfortable with an {PERCENT} ROE,6,47,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.442099745,55.13,24475.79412,11,0.360227828,1.16022,2008-Oct-15,STT
So the expenses going forward in taking and moving them forward out of R&D and SG&A from {DATE} level should be at this level or lower Is that the way you look at it,2,34,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.442099745,55.13,24475.79412,11,0.360227828,1.16022,2008-Oct-15,STT
So notwithstanding favorable natural gas costs that advantage was wiped out either in whole or in part by lower electricity prices,1,21,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09523809523809523,0.0,4.100287544,55.13,19623.88588,12,0.824011397,0.33909,2008-Oct-15,CSX
Great And then just couple of quick housekeeping questions Didier What are you looking for FX impact in And what was the M&A impact on {DATE},4,26,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.038461538461538464,0.038461538461538464,4.100287544,55.13,19623.88588,12,0.824011397,0.33909,2008-Oct-15,CSX
{CARDINAL} final one for John Just on the EBITDA for Sunquest does that {MONEY} include the associated DA that comes with the acquisition accounting or is that the organic number,2,30,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.875177975,55.13,158956.1439,11,0.838316407,1.40526,2008-Oct-15,JPM
All right {CARDINAL} more and I 'll get back in the queue here What is the new share count assumption embedded in the current guidance for {DATE},4,27,1,0.0,0.0,0.037037037037037035,0.0,0.0,5.277611502,69.25,7436.353679999998,10,0.071518396,2.84427,2008-Oct-16,ISRG
Great and then maybe a second one on M&A. If you maybe looked at your funnel from here on potential pipeline deals can you maybe give us a sense of how the US versus ex US pipeline looks Is it fair to say we 're going to keep seeing a vast majority of your deals flow ex US,3,58,1,0.0,0.05172413793103448,0.05172413793103448,0.017241379310344827,0.0,3.1408077960000003,69.25,17492.31424,3,0.338671991,0.19074,2008-Oct-16,ITW
Sure Now in that regard Steve you made a comment that the stronger gas price environment has made some of your gas assets more attractive to buyers So what gas assets might move up in the queue to be sold and in that regard what are you looking at or is there something there that may move up in the queue given the strong gas price environment per your comment,3,70,1,0.0,0.02857142857142857,0.02857142857142857,0.04285714285714286,0.0,3.115016092,69.25,8484.253920000001,12,1.057054199,0.50569,2008-Oct-16,LUV
Just a follow up on that So it 's essentially the actions that you need to take whether it 's on the calling or the pricing side largely complete at {TIME} Is that the message on the third book of business that you 're referring to,3,46,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.115016092,69.25,8484.253920000001,12,1.057054199,0.50569,2008-Oct-16,LUV
Okay Yes that 's helpful On the flexibility you have in terms of capacity for {DATE} should I think about the driver there in terms of up or down is that really going to be a function of the demand and pricing trends that you 're seeing or should I think of it more as you guys using that as a means of managing CASM growth,3,66,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.36083276,69.25,5804.92262,9,0.204961905,5.2838699999999985,2008-Oct-16,SHW
Got it And then the final question on the wholesale gross profit per wholesale vehicle that popped up more Was there something funny there or is that more reflective of the overall environment too,3,34,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.029411764705882353,3.36083276,69.25,5804.92262,9,0.204961905,5.2838699999999985,2008-Oct-16,SHW
Okay that 's certainly helpful And then Andy a quick question for you around services I know we have the drag of slower product growth {DATE} dragging overall services down But as we think about the slow down here to {PERCENT} {PERCENT} growth {DATE} do you think this is the low water mark and we should stabilize here Or what 's the visibility into the services maintenance business When do you think that could start to re accelerate,6,78,1,0.0,0.01282051282051282,0.01282051282051282,0.01282051282051282,0.05128205128205128,3.36083276,69.25,5804.92262,9,0.204961905,5.2838699999999985,2008-Oct-16,SHW
Okay {CARDINAL} other HCR question and I think Ross had a follow up on something else Are you spending much time {DATE} with hiring your own counsel or doing your own due diligence on what the ultimate outcome of this complaint might be and how it impacts HCP And if so are you actually accruing expenses for that {DATE} And where would that be showing up on your P&L,5,69,1,0.0,0.014492753623188406,0.014492753623188406,0.0,0.028985507246376812,2.982996547,69.25,21988.59896,10,0.179866962,0.81295,2008-Oct-16,SYK
Yes so basically {PERCENT} of the {MONEY} that you provided {DATE} at this time and then what 's the other color around the macro factors that you 're saying might be down,1,32,1,0.0,0.03125,0.03125,0.0,0.0,4.974344032,69.25,4739.61966,3,0.222843822,0.34457,2008-Oct-16,TXT
Just {CARDINAL} other Give that in {DATE} you 'll be running at full capacity and you 've given some initial forecast {DATE} for {PERCENT} industry growth the panelmakers keep talking about continued shortage of {DATE} What 's your strategy going into {DATE} in terms of adding additional volume Are you going to add based on the market growth of {PERCENT} or would you add different numbers based on perhaps a desire to gain some share {DATE} or not Could you talk about how you approach the capacity additions for {DATE},5,90,1,0.0,0.022222222222222223,0.022222222222222223,0.011111111111111112,0.011111111111111112,4.974344032,69.25,4739.61966,3,0.222843822,0.34457,2008-Oct-16,TXT
Maybe just {CARDINAL} more that ties into it You have a good table in the Q that shows some of the anti dilutive securities outstanding That has the CIC units and MUFG preferred stock and some other option stuff How are you thinking about share count There 's some things that are like hard time lines and some of them are more stock related As the call goes on a little further MUFG will be in the money So how do you think about future share count and your ability to offset some of that through repurchases,7,97,1,0.0,0.010309278350515464,0.010309278350515464,0.010309278350515464,0.0,4.974344032,69.25,4739.61966,3,0.222843822,0.34457,2008-Oct-16,TXT
Just a very quick one Vince The stock buyback once you finish up in {DATE} what room does it have for capital allocation {DATE},2,24,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.273138513,69.25,47494.58225,3,0.283671692,0.6971,2008-Oct-16,UTX

Then on a different topic if we look at your {DATE} revenue here you have got {DATE} at essentially {MONEY} If you go back in {DATE} you have peaked at {MONEY} on a {DATE} rate with your margins {DATE} they are at the gross margin or at the EBIT are {CARDINAL} basis points lower What needs to happen to be able to close that gap here And do you think you could that can happen,4,75,1,0.0,0.013333333333333334,0.013333333333333334,0.013333333333333334,0.0,6.6278148460000015,69.25,17671.5984,11,0.7543996740000001,0.05926,2008-Oct-16,BBT

That 's okay Then just one final follow up on trauma it kicked off quite a bit earlier and faster than we were expecting Is this the rate that we are looking at sort of a sustainable high teens double digit kind of rate or is this something we should expect to moderate {DATE},3,54,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11.00220113,69.25,3148.1934,11,1.100464332,0.5,2008-Oct-16,HBAN

Yes thank you If you look at the midpoint of your {DATE} op margin targets of {PERCENT} and you combine that with quarter 's {PERCENT} it implies a first {CARDINAL} operating margin of around {DATE} which is a bit below your {PERCENT} target that you gave us at your analysts day So does this suggest you need a better second half of the year or is that difference really within your margin of error of your targets,3,77,1,0.0,0.012987012987012988,0.012987012987012988,0.012987012987012988,0.012987012987012988,4.766613373,67.61,63818.5604,4,0.12648193800000002,0.14644,2008-Oct-17,SLB

Okay And then I guess my second question Diana for you In the past you have talked about priorities with respect to using your cash or managing your capital structure I 'm just wondering in this environment would debt paydown move up with respect to your priorities relative to acquisitions and buying shares or is it pretty much the same order with your emphasis being on acquisitions first,4,68,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.014705882352941176,5.886810339,70.33,27048.382060000004,11,0.183086882,1.58778,2008-Oct-20,AXP
Also on the core business pricing was up as well Is that primarily the United contract escalators Is there something else too that drove that,3,25,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.886810339,70.33,27048.382060000004,11,0.183086882,1.58778,2008-Oct-20,AXP
But just as a on the M&A strategy I think you have been consistent {DATE} saying there is nothing major on the horizon Is that accurate or maybe just to reiterate what your thoughts are on M&A for {DATE},2,39,1,0.0,0.02564102564102564,0.02564102564102564,0.0,0.0,5.886810339,70.33,27048.382060000004,11,0.183086882,1.58778,2008-Oct-20,AXP
Okay {CARDINAL} last question The announcement of the new Board director was there an opening on the board or was that more of a strategic addition kind of given changing focus of the Company going more international,2,37,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02702702702702703,3.459468062,52.97,4836.4071,6,0.073405455,3.63665,2008-Oct-21,WAT
{CARDINAL} last question on Climax The guys at General Moly had announced that they 're teaming up with the Chinese on getting the financing to start their mine in Nevada How does that impact your outlook on Climax restart,3,39,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02564102564102564,2.850496632,52.97,36947.93344,3,0.227528809,0.81581,2008-Oct-21,LMT
Thanks for taking my question guys Peter on the cost side you had tremendous operating margins {DATE} As you look forward you maintain the cost goals for {DATE} Is that in anticipation of what 's coming around the Windows Phone launch and Connect Or are there ways to continue to see you be a lot more efficient on the cost side over {DATE},5,63,1,0.0,0.0,0.015873015873015872,0.031746031746031744,0.015873015873015872,2.850496632,52.97,36947.93344,3,0.227528809,0.81581,2008-Oct-21,LMT
They have n't been asking you for any more pricing or cost information for products in which you produce commercially,1,20,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.543255546,52.97,3878.29296,3,0.380507169,1.33699,2008-Oct-21,AVY
My final question is just in terms of capital management it seems very clear that you are not looking to do anything of size that is not to your liking but conversely as you look at your footprint now and you see what is growing and what is not are there other areas that might be pruned that can be reinvested into faster growth parts of the business,1,68,1,0.0,0.014705882352941176,0.029411764705882353,0.0,0.014705882352941176,3.543255546,52.97,3878.29296,3,0.380507169,1.33699,2008-Oct-21,AVY
I guess {CARDINAL} questions {CARDINAL} you talk about a targeted payout of {PERCENT} If Mission were no longer if Mission were to file for bankruptcy should we assume that you would be targeting the same level of payout or would that potentially change,3,43,1,0.0,0.0,0.023255813953488372,0.0,0.046511627906976744,3.543255546,52.97,3878.29296,3,0.380507169,1.33699,2008-Oct-21,AVY
You 've mentioned several times that not only does high dollar content but also your margin profile of this product is it accretive to mobile Accretive to consolidated margins Can you give us a feel for that You mentioned a MIPI controller et cetera or a digital controller Does it include any of the ET products By that I mean amplifiers or modulators,6,63,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.387931069,52.97,2825.70084,3,0.464538114,0.78809,2008-Oct-21,SWK
Question on capital and specifically your thinking about including or excluding the AOCI from your capital numbers You noted in the release that they would benefit {DATE} from the inclusion of AOCI How are you thinking about that going forward given the rising rate environment would be likely to create some additional volatility in that number that might be less welcome,3,61,1,0.0,0.01639344262295082,0.03278688524590164,0.01639344262295082,0.03278688524590164,3.387931069,52.97,2825.70084,3,0.464538114,0.78809,2008-Oct-21,SWK
I was just wondering with regard to your tenant sales if you had any regional breakouts Particularly I 'm looking to see if there was a weather impact so if we could compare California to the Northeast or Midwest,2,39,1,0.0,0.02564102564102564,0.02564102564102564,0.0,0.0,3.192813333,52.97,10644.732,12,0.277908233,0.74762,2008-Oct-21,OMC
And then can you give us a sense for where your Medicare Advantage admissions stand as a percentage of total admissions and how that may have changed in {DATE},1,29,1,0.0,0.034482758620689655,0.034482758620689655,0.034482758620689655,0.0,2.663685488,52.97,2926.761760000001,6,0.250517925,2.74657,2008-Oct-21,CERN
Okay And then maybe just broadly re contracting You are talking about some of the things you are doing proactively on price But can you just remind us are you pretty much done with the major contracts that need to be renewed for {DATE} however you define major Are there any opportunities out there that you are bidding on that may be things that you could potentially pick up,4,69,1,0.0,0.043478260869565216,0.043478260869565216,0.028985507246376812,0.0,2.663685488,52.97,2926.761760000001,6,0.250517925,2.74657,2008-Oct-21,CERN
Great that 's helpful And to follow up on the slick water comment sounds like working nicely in East Pony That potential for the rest of the field as well,3,30,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03333333333333333,0.0,2.663685488,52.97,2926.761760000001,6,0.250517925,2.74657,2008-Oct-21,CERN
And then lastly and maybe this is it gets a little bit esoteric but I am just trying to understand the philosophy around the commentary I think at the end of the analysts day where you said that we should expect flattish margins looking forward over time If that is the incorrect comment you can obviously let me know But is that philosophy of spending on marketing and programming in line with revenue over a long period of time based on what you think you need to spend to stay competitive and maintain sort of your existing success in ratings level Or is that based on a spending level that you think is going to drive growth in the categories,4,120,1,0.0,0.008333333333333333,0.008333333333333333,0.008333333333333333,0.008333333333333333,4.2455343,52.97,7134.76554,12,0.112737889,0.74421,2008-Oct-21,CHRW
Going back to Mark 's comments about having a lot of confidence in the top line outlook it seems like the issue that you guys are facing a lot of it is unfortunately outside of your hands I mean given retailers whether they are aggressively reducing inventory and I would like to hear your comments on that or the economy worsens so it seems like I am just trying to figure how you guys can have a lot of visibility to the top line when the issues are primarily macro in nature at this point,3,95,1,0.0,0.0,0.021052631578947368,0.0,0.021052631578947368,4.2455343,52.97,7134.76554,12,0.112737889,0.74421,2008-Oct-21,CHRW
Okay And then just lastly do you need the {MONEY} of net cash and what 's holding you back from stepping up on the buyback given fairly constructive comments about {DATE} of the calendar year,2,35,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02857142857142857,0.0,4.2455343,52.97,7134.76554,12,0.112737889,0.74421,2008-Oct-21,CHRW
And last question just following up on Tim 's question on CapEx this {PERCENT} {PERCENT} of revenue level if you had to guess at a steady state model is that the pretty good benchmark or do you think you can get more efficient than that over time,1,47,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0425531914893617,0.0425531914893617,8.120948809,52.97,1253.05536,11,1.7290587469999998,2.6688,2008-Oct-21,ETFC
Certainly a strong partner with Fuji If I think about that as a channel for you to place devices is this still {DATE} Or are you seeing traction and placements growing to a more material number Or is it really an {DATE} {CARDINAL} story where we will see more from you there,4,52,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.019230769230769232,0.0,2.720167732,52.97,8312.6232,10,0.344279764,1.28347,2008-Oct-21,DGX
Okay Then last question Rich what is your latest thought on the tax rate for {DATE},2,16,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0625,2.720167732,52.97,8312.6232,10,0.344279764,1.28347,2008-Oct-21,DGX
Thanks guys A couple of quick questions if I might on Kay Mike I think you talked about some new accounts It looks like you might lap those so have {CARDINAL} more big quarter in {DATE} and then back towards a more moderate run rate Is that fair,5,48,1,0.0,0.041666666666666664,0.041666666666666664,0.0,0.020833333333333332,2.9285840380000003,52.97,2992.45416,10,0.320779521,0.10127,2008-Oct-21,EW
There were a couple of different technology initiatives associated with the personal lines is that all fully rolled out now,1,20,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.9285840380000003,52.97,2992.45416,10,0.320779521,0.10127,2008-Oct-21,EW
Good {TIME} You talked on the working capital slide about some specific action plans to ship projects by {DATE} Just given you 've called out many of these as kind of customer driven delays I was curious how much control you feel you really have over getting them out the door,3,51,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0196078431372549,0.0196078431372549,2.9285840380000003,52.97,2992.45416,10,0.320779521,0.10127,2008-Oct-21,EW
That 's really helpful And then maybe a little bit on revenue growth in this area Is that in line with transaction growth Or some of these large clients maybe making that a little bit lower,4,36,1,0.0,0.05555555555555555,0.05555555555555555,0.0,0.0,5.1596020860000005,52.97,13855.34997,10,0.359766036,2.86786,2008-Oct-21,BIIB
Hi good {TIME} Just based on our estimate it looks like your profit contribution between behavioral and acute if you factor in Ascend is close to {PERCENT} behavioral and {PERCENT} acute if we do some estimate allocation As you look at your mix of M&A and you think about your portfolio do you think that number is a good number Is that going to hold or are we at the high water mark in terms of the relative behavioral mix in the business,4,83,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.024096385542168676,0.0,4.312310308,53.11,3713.93351,6,0.258135388,5.29085,2008-Oct-22,CTXS
Thanks good {TIME} On the Trans Atlantic capacity you guys have talked about coming down a little bit in {DATE} Is that being done collectively with your JV partner so that maybe total industry capacity reductions are more than even what you guys are pulling out,3,46,1,0.0,0.021739130434782608,0.021739130434782608,0.021739130434782608,0.0,5.023819864,53.11,12935.5168,10,1.002187439,1.43261,2008-Oct-22,BSX
It 's good to see I guess looking into {DATE} are there any other big investments needed to keep on pace with the size and scale you 're turning into,2,30,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03333333333333333,0.0,5.023819864,53.11,12935.5168,10,1.002187439,1.43261,2008-Oct-22,BSX
Okay That 's fine Can I have just {CARDINAL} final quick question I think earlier {DATE} the news come out saying that Rex Tillerson indicated that {DATE} that your spending would be roughly flat at {MONEY} Wondering if you can confirm whether he has said that or not,5,48,1,0.0,0.0,0.020833333333333332,0.0,0.020833333333333332,2.14172629,53.11,7888.5894,10,0.196691829,2.98425,2008-Oct-22,BCR
Okay And then lastly on the acquisition side it sounds like your balance sheet is pretty much or actually pretty strong here Are you guys looking for acquisitions actively and would you prefer a personal care or household business,3,39,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02564102564102564,0.0,4.085675552,53.11,12049.34544,5,0.394584658,1.49383,2008-Oct-22,APD
So it 's predominantly memory then The rest you still see as being somewhat favorable then,2,16,1,0.0,0.0625,0.0625,0.0625,0.0,4.085675552,53.11,12049.34544,5,0.394584658,1.49383,2008-Oct-22,APD
Okay And obviously the global group had a great quarter and I think on {DATE} call you indicated you expected segment sales to be up mid to high single digits for {DATE} Given the strong performance {DATE} is kind of low double digits more realistic,4,45,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044444444444444446,0.0,3.628386045,53.11,55417.47,10,0.363488475,4.3261400000000005,2008-Oct-22,AMGN
Right I guess I was wondering if there was a if there was a decrease in usage I know that I think Lasan was asking about demand destruction You guys said no Are you seeing any conservation efforts or anything like that that 's going on or of course you guys have your own initiatives Is that having any impact on retail sales,7,63,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.015873015873015872,3.628386045,53.11,55417.47,10,0.363488475,4.3261400000000005,2008-Oct-22,AMGN
Hi just a quick question I wonder if you could put a perspective for me what you would need to see either in terms of a pressure on occupancy or on rents themselves before there would be any kind of pressure on the dividend,2,44,1,0.0,0.022727272727272728,0.022727272727272728,0.0,0.022727272727272728,6.099639609,53.11,2044.80873,11,0.219565132,2.63495,2008-Oct-22,AMG
Are you adjusting terms in any cases where your preference is just to keep that retailer for a shorter period of time but perhaps replace that tenant down the road,1,30,1,0.0,0.03333333333333333,0.03333333333333333,0.0,0.0,5.110523253,53.11,21540.23136,6,0.031060059,0.8341299999999999,2008-Oct-22,AMZN
Maybe by {DATE} that part of it has worked through,1,10,1,0.0,0.1,0.1,0.0,0.0,5.110523253,53.11,21540.23136,6,0.031060059,0.8341299999999999,2008-Oct-22,AMZN
Okay and just a clarification on that I guess what 's normal from an interest rate perspective in your mind,2,20,1,0.0,0.0,0.05,0.0,0.0,2.799921335,53.11,13253.71068,1,0.444532113,5.84622,2008-Oct-22,RAI^G17
Got it Secondly in terms of the SG&A you guys obviously have done a good job of managing that {DATE} and Mark you mentioned earlier about some reinvestment {DATE} In terms of the amount of reinvestment you are I guess target has been {CARDINAL} of gross margin expansion getting reinvested Is that still a good assumption for {DATE} as well,4,60,1,0.0,0.0,0.016666666666666666,0.03333333333333333,0.0,2.799921335,53.11,13253.71068,1,0.444532113,5.84622,2008-Oct-22,RAI^G17
Hi thank you Just a first question how should we be thinking about system business gross margin going forward Are there some metrics you can kind of give us on this,3,31,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03225806451612903,5.943138007000001,53.11,21463.764,11,0.7871353440000001,0.42576,2008-Oct-22,TRV
Okay Good {TIME} Actually I had a couple little questions on the mortgage side of your business {CARDINAL} was your loans held for sale fell by {MONEY} despite the increase in closings I was wondering if this just reflected your ability to sell these loans faster And curious since it did help the cash flow,5,55,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03636363636363636,0.03636363636363636,5.943138007000001,53.11,21463.764,11,0.7871353440000001,0.42576,2008-Oct-22,TRV
Just wanted to dig a little bit more into the HPLC business {DATE} I think you said that recurring revenue growth was {PERCENT} So is it fair to say that underlying market growth for the HPLC market is in that sort of high single digit range and then maybe if you could layer on top of that the components in your business {DATE} that really drove the outperformance beyond just sort of H Class adoption And what I mean by that specifically is was there any real change in your view around market share and dynamics within some of the specific end markets that were perhaps above long term trend line for HPLC,4,113,1,0.0,0.02654867256637168,0.02654867256637168,0.0,0.0,2.724121246,53.11,62003.49814,9,0.23657997100000006,3.62373,2008-Oct-22,MCD
So I was going to say is it possible I 'm sure the answer is yes would you sort of put a number around the backlog that you are looking at,2,31,1,0.0,0.03225806451612903,0.03225806451612903,0.0,0.0,6.529282076,53.11,2932.06292,4,0.676885475,0.32243,2008-Oct-22,NFX
So it sounds like more in tranches when you have capital to do so Is that correct,2,17,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.529282076,53.11,2932.06292,4,0.676885475,0.32243,2008-Oct-22,NFX
First question I 'm wondering if you can just give us a little bit of color on what 's expected in guidance from a geographic perspective Nick had talked I think about Europe being up in the mid single digits for the academic business but are you assuming in general that Europe holds steady and then also China You talked {PERCENT} growth {DATE} Does that come in {DATE} What 's embedded in the expectations,5,74,1,0.0,0.0,0.013513513513513514,0.0,0.013513513513513514,3.941738719,53.11,20211.97013,12,0.844562849,3.35861,2008-Oct-22,NSC

First question I had Jim wanted to go back to your comments on the winding down of Sunrise and Hydro One and then the increase on CREZ As you 're looking at those knowing that both Sunrise and Hydro were done on a more compressed time schedule do you think that the increase on the CREZ projects is going to be enough to offset them as we move kind of {CARDINAL} into or should we expect maybe a little bit of softening just on the overall level given those dynamics,2,90,1,0.0,0.011111111111111112,0.011111111111111112,0.0,0.011111111111111112,6.311740678,69.96,9009.47985,4,0.371727814,3.25427,2008-Oct-30,MUR
Lastly the T&M margin pressure is that mostly operating leverage,1,10,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.111623738,69.96,8650.69911,11,0.4936444370000001,13.29481,2008-Oct-30,EQR
Bob what I was wondering it sounds like that ADC will take a while to build into products It 's not going to happen overnight but I assume that 's driven by a customer need Customers are wanting some ADC integration There 's no opportunity to work with them to do joint solutions for customers or something like that,4,59,1,0.0,0.0,0.01694915254237288,0.01694915254237288,0.0,6.111623738,69.96,8650.69911,11,0.4936444370000001,13.29481,2008-Oct-30,EQR
All right great You mentioned the {CARDINAL} new names that were added Can you give us a sense whether maybe international versus domestic what kind of trends you 're seeing in the new name portion of the net names,3,39,1,0.0,0.02564102564102564,0.02564102564102564,0.02564102564102564,0.0,6.111623738,69.96,8650.69911,11,0.4936444370000001,13.29481,2008-Oct-30,EQR
Got it thanks Then just quickly I wondered on the whole crassets you gave some update last time If there was anything to add this time in your thinking,3,29,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.698252085,69.96,3513.95579,6,0.420845926,1.61146,2008-Oct-30,KLAC
Fair enough And I think Rick and your comments you talked maybe about the pipeline for C&I building in {DATE} Is there anything if I heard you wrong correct me but if that is the case is there any {CARDINAL} industry or perhaps region that you can point to that is showing maybe some of that recovery in {DATE},3,59,1,0.0,0.05084745762711865,0.05084745762711865,0.0,0.01694915254237288,3.698252085,69.96,3513.95579,6,0.420845926,1.61146,2008-Oct-30,KLAC
Great Thanks And {CARDINAL} other one if I may You made a couple of comments on capital deployment and you mentioned the buyback as part of the overall deployment strategy Can you talk about the how aggressive you might be with a buyback like that Could you do something perhaps accelerated or is that not really in the cards,6,59,1,0.0,0.06779661016949153,0.06779661016949153,0.01694915254237288,0.0,6.779036944,62.9,5064.971360000001,11,0.965748933,1.15547,2008-Oct-31,UNM
Okay and then on the patient comms one of the initiatives was to rationalize some of the call centers Where are we on that,2,24,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041666666666666664,6.779036944,62.9,5064.971360000001,11,0.965748933,1.15547,2008-Oct-31,UNM
Okay Thanks for that {CARDINAL} other question on the RIIO process It sounds like you are expecting that all {CARDINAL} of your units would get fast track treatment Is that a fair read of your comments Or would you not want to go that far,6,45,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.022222222222222223,5.166414211,62.9,8172.42644,12,0.723893039,0.37385,2008-Oct-31,WY

Okay Do you allocate a materially different amount of capital to that than your overall business or I guess it 's in the same ZIP code,2,26,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.639175721,59.89,5148.88752,6,0.13655630300000002,2.38368,2008-Nov-03,PBI
Great {CARDINAL} quick follow up I know you touched on a couple of different markets If you think about regional differences across the business anything significant other than say the strength of Florida that you discussed,4,36,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05555555555555555,0.0,6.653145262000001,59.89,15083.82793,11,0.145735192,0.30604000000000003,2008-Nov-03,SPG
Yes good {TIME} I just wanted to follow up on that question Patrick with a {CARDINAL} to {CARDINAL} point impact on commercial {DATE} from Bombardier that would imply to me that your Bombardier sales are {MONEY} Could you validate that Also would that make Bombardier your biggest business jet customer,4,50,1,0.0,0.02,0.02,0.02,0.02,3.410781393,59.89,15754.5578,9,0.238774797,0.64549,2008-Nov-03,SYY
Just on the operating profit guidance for DBA it looks like you took it up {MONEY} is there some offset to that within your {DATE} guidance,1,26,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.5318912630000003,59.89,5919.04182,3,0.185916644,1.99357,2008-Nov-03,COL
Just lastly your raw material outlook is part of the guidance steel I guess debatably could be moving higher How are you guys thinking about raw materials and the metals specifically maybe what 's the sensitivity as part of your outlook,2,41,1,0.0,0.04878048780487805,0.04878048780487805,0.0,0.0,4.064880397,53.68,12155.97786,8,0.398484106,5.447030000000002,2008-Nov-04,PPL
Thanks very much You had tremendous revenue growth in {DATE} but your deferred revenues now at your deferred revenues are pretty flat or flat to down versus {DATE} Does that mean that revenues should flatten out in {DATE},3,38,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02631578947368421,0.0,4.064880397,53.68,12155.97786,8,0.398484106,5.447030000000002,2008-Nov-04,PPL
Okay great So that implies a good trend to {DATE} And then just lastly on the it sounds like from what you 're saying on the capital rules obviously everything is preliminary It does n't sound to me like there 's any change in your philosophy about returning something {PERCENT} of earnings to shareholders via buyback and dividends Is that correct And as we think about the CCAR process I know it 's early but the CCAR process for {DATE},6,80,1,0.0,0.0,0.0125,0.025,0.0,9.632474422,53.68,5799.01,11,0.417572023,0.74195,2008-Nov-04,PFG
Okay Thank you And on my second question in listening to some of the panel makers in their recent earnings calls as they give preliminary outlooks for {DATE} initial comments from them kind of suggest glass volume growth in the {PERCENT} {PERCENT} range And I know it 's early but do you have a view as to whether that number is a reasonable estimate or does it look conservative given that the growth {DATE} is going to be {CARDINAL},4,79,1,0.0,0.012658227848101266,0.02531645569620253,0.0,0.012658227848101266,4.131477721,53.68,2732.835,6,0.127186715,1.74577,2008-Nov-04,TDC
That is clearly the case {CARDINAL} last thing on this topic which is would you characterize any part of your product line as more discretionary than others In other words the airlines could back off or slow down or is everything mandated by either flight {TIME} or cycles,3,48,1,0.020833333333333332,0.020833333333333332,0.020833333333333332,0.0,0.020833333333333332,2.201931801,53.68,3959.8209,5,0.347039262,2.29676,2008-Nov-04,CHD
If we could talk about margins real quick just both on the wireless and the wireline side On the wireless side very strong Obviously above longer term corporate guidance Can you just talk about some of the drivers there And then as we sort of look out into how the competitive environment keeps evolving is that sort of what we can expect going forward And then on the wireline side obviously very different than your longer term guidance Is this the sort of level or in this range is what we can expect while the economy remains weak It sounded like a lot of the drivers that you talked about in the prepared remarks were really driven by the economy and obviously it could be some time before things improved Plus this sector is generally thought of as something of a lagging indicator Is this sort of the right level say for going forward in {DATE},10,156,1,0.0,0.01282051282051282,0.01282051282051282,0.01282051282051282,0.01282051282051282,2.201931801,53.68,3959.8209,5,0.347039262,2.29676,2008-Nov-04,CHD
Just plugging in those ranges that you gave it looks like it is a fairly healthy range there {MONEY} on the downside and {MONEY} on the upside So is that ball park and is it fair to say that at {MONEY} that maybe you are a little bit more comfortable at the downside end of those ranges,2,57,1,0.0,0.017543859649122806,0.017543859649122806,0.0,0.0,2.201931801,53.68,3959.8209,5,0.347039262,2.29676,2008-Nov-04,CHD
As a quick follow up to Allison 's question with regard to the fixed variable component with the domestic coal expected to be down even more strongly {DATE} should we expect coal yields to improve sequentially even with the lower fuel price or is kind of a pretty good run rate for us,1,53,1,0.018867924528301886,0.0,0.018867924528301886,0.03773584905660377,0.018867924528301886,2.201931801,53.68,3959.8209,5,0.347039262,2.29676,2008-Nov-04,CHD
You have been consistent with your price discipline raising your base germplasm prices by {PERCENT} I guess over {DATE} but this new pricing model is not tested in an environment of falling prices So if corn were to go down if corn prices were to fall because of yield or whatever do you think you can raise pricing {PERCENT} without upsetting your customers,2,63,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.068903837000001,53.68,15520.51049,4,0.8630605029999999,1.50308,2008-Nov-04,APC
Thank you First on the gross margin performance in {DATE} If you parse it out how much do you think was sustainable driven by some of the initiatives within the Company And how much was due to the late extended {DATE},4,41,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.024390243902439025,7.068903837000001,53.68,15520.51049,4,0.8630605029999999,1.50308,2008-Nov-04,APC
Could you just give us a sense on margins as we trend through {CARDINAL} and into {CARDINAL} and I guess into the full your {DATE} what should the {DATE} progression in margins be Have we seen the bottoming out and we should start to see improvement or what 's the cadence going to look like,2,55,1,0.0,0.01818181818181818,0.01818181818181818,0.01818181818181818,0.0,7.068903837000001,53.68,15520.51049,4,0.8630605029999999,1.50308,2008-Nov-04,APC
Yes thanks First question is for Al Al is there any concern that the additional changes that you made to the prior periods the {CARDINAL} for revenue and the deferred revenue change is there any concern that that might actually delay the time it will take to get current on the filings,3,52,1,0.0,0.019230769230769232,0.019230769230769232,0.0,0.07692307692307693,7.068903837000001,53.68,15520.51049,4,0.8630605029999999,1.50308,2008-Nov-04,APC
Yes good {TIME} Thank you for taking my question I guess a couple questions here First off just directionally can you comment on order outlook by segment,4,27,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037037037037037035,0.07407407407407407,3.797189486,53.68,6776.75114,8,0.788792505,0.8754799999999999,2008-Nov-04,AEE
And just back to the Investment Bank for a moment is there any change in your compensation structure that you are anticipating for {DATE} early as it is in terms of stock cash mix or anything like that that would have driven a lower percentage accrual than what we usually would see for you guys,1,55,1,0.0,0.0,0.01818181818181818,0.0,0.0,3.797189486,53.68,6776.75114,8,0.788792505,0.8754799999999999,2008-Nov-04,AEE
Okay and then just finally {CARDINAL} quick ones for Neil CapEx dropped significantly to {MONEY} Is that a more normal CapEx number for the company,3,25,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04,3.797189486,53.68,6776.75114,8,0.788792505,0.8754799999999999,2008-Nov-04,AEE
Excellent and then jumping over to Haley rumors out there that some partners going non consent Is that true and what are the implications for Anadarko,2,26,1,0.0,0.0,0.038461538461538464,0.038461538461538464,0.0,3.797189486,53.68,6776.75114,8,0.788792505,0.8754799999999999,2008-Nov-04,AEE
With regard to the Sioux scrubbers it seems that the bulk of that {MONEY} {MONEY} CapEx cut of the regulated businesses it is really just the scrubber right,1,28,1,0.0,0.0,0.03571428571428571,0.0,0.03571428571428571,3.797189486,53.68,6776.75114,8,0.788792505,0.8754799999999999,2008-Nov-04,AEE
Sure Makes sense Good to have you back as well Just on the gross margin side benefits and comment on that {CARDINAL} offer kind of temporary impact of {MONEY} Does that fade {DATE} so we go back to gross margins that are something more or does it effectively impact through {DATE} Kind of fades through {DATE},6,56,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.017857142857142856,0.0,3.881774949,53.68,3100.38652,1,1.046431076,0.14414000000000002,2008-Nov-04,MHK
Hello good {TIME} A question on the core side of the business and volumes it looks like the growth picked up a little bit sequentially Is that purely the Easter impact or are you seeing maybe people using more benefits ahead of potential unemployment or is that a you know is that not a clear trend,4,56,1,0.0,0.017857142857142856,0.017857142857142856,0.017857142857142856,0.03571428571428571,3.881774949,53.68,3100.38652,1,1.046431076,0.14414000000000002,2008-Nov-04,MHK
Jeff you had mentioned throughout your commentary that freight and warehousing was lower Is that market conditions or is there something that Hormel is doing that 's more structural,2,29,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.71684002,53.68,6879.235,11,0.505002886,0.5352,2008-Nov-04,HCP

Okay Do you think it might be difficult to ask you how to handicap it but do you think there will be a chance you will start share repurchases before {DATE},2,31,1,0.0,0.03225806451612903,0.03225806451612903,0.0,0.03225806451612903,5.3395192510000005,47.73,6114.927,6,0.151747896,1.57075,2008-Nov-05,CTSH
Okay And then just on store closures for {TIME} the stores as you 've progressed over {DATE} and you look at areas or clusters of areas where you 've closed stores whether at multiple concepts in {CARDINAL} mall and you have closed {CARDINAL} or {CARDINAL} of them can you just comment on what you 've seen on those remaining stores in those malls or in those close proximity just in terms of the comp performance and the trends in terms of what is happening as you closed those stores in those areas,2,92,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.010869565217391304,0.043478260869565216,6.836575519,47.73,3495.21018,4,0.743053477,2.25593,2008-Nov-05,PXD
Great And then on the gross margin side you mentioned the LIFO reserve Is it fair to say given the timing of the promotions and that that LIFO reserve is behind you and easier compares that that 's why we expect gross margin to get better in the back {CARDINAL} or is there something else we should be watching given you are trying to take down inventory etc that could hurt the margin,4,73,1,0.0,0.0136986301369863,0.0136986301369863,0.0410958904109589,0.0136986301369863,6.836575519,47.73,3495.21018,4,0.743053477,2.25593,2008-Nov-05,PXD
That 's helpful And then on Bell lastly back to the question about outperforming your own expectations on a pretty consistent basis When is the next repricing that you 'd have to worry about Is it not until the multi {DATE} expiration in {CARDINAL} {CARDINAL} that would be kind of be a material repricing event or is there anything nearer term that could put downward pressure on some of your more established programs,4,73,1,0.0,0.0136986301369863,0.0136986301369863,0.0136986301369863,0.0410958904109589,3.292350057,47.73,15233.13,11,0.567849516,2.857,2008-Nov-05,MMC
I was just interested in your commentary about a new flavor technology that might be coming for {DATE} Just how would you manage your expectations around that potential impact that we might see in that business over {DATE} or {CARDINAL},2,40,1,0.0,0.05,0.05,0.0,0.0,3.292350057,47.73,15233.13,11,0.567849516,2.857,2008-Nov-05,MMC

So the CapEx of {CARDINAL} {CARDINAL} wo n't be materially different from what 's in the slides {DATE},1,18,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.322299794,47.73,2470.56585,11,0.279788853,1.1547,2008-Nov-05,DLR
Okay Got it Just from my understanding are your margins significantly lower than what you 're seeing now and that is where the big sort of lever will be over {DATE} once you get the cost savings through,3,38,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.322299794,47.73,2470.56585,11,0.279788853,1.1547,2008-Nov-05,DLR
Okay Maybe just to drill into annuities a little bit obviously the sales number did come down as targeted and I think in the opening remarks you alluded to product changes My question is do you have any further planned changes in annuities going forward and are there any other changes that you are making at the distribution level that is helping to control the sales level towards the target of {MONEY} range for {DATE},5,75,1,0.0,0.013333333333333334,0.013333333333333334,0.0,0.013333333333333334,4.5081694180000005,47.73,3989.08608,8,0.736672215,5.73377,2008-Nov-05,CNP
Great And then just a follow up The balance sheet really remains really strong here Can you talk about the acquisition environment which of the {CARDINAL} businesses are you sort of seeing more opportunities in and how do valuations look on a relative basis And then is there any willingness to move outside of those {CARDINAL} segments where you currently compete,5,61,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04918032786885246,0.0,2.801885073,47.73,4132.6225,9,0.338122193,1.36311,2008-Nov-05,HSIC
Okay and then second in terms of the global sovereign mandate I think you mentioned related outflows were {MONEY} {DATE} which is down from prior levels So is this a good run rate going forward and then can you just give us an update on how much is left in terms of that mandate,2,54,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.018518518518518517,0.0,6.044251888,54.56,4570.4061299999985,6,0.197443953,2.14594,2008-Nov-06,NVDA
Good {TIME} First question about some of the capacity to things on slide {CARDINAL} here Congrats on the Board approving the plants for a new gas plant there at IPL Definitely good to take another step forward there My question though is if you are extending the contract at Duane Arnold it is I understand from a megawatt basis that you are going to be retiring some of these old gas plants from {DATE} But as you say yourself there 's {PERCENT} of energy needs {DATE} Given how oversupplied MISO is how confident are you that there will be a need for the energy coming from a new plant as opposed to buying from other plants,9,116,1,0.008620689655172414,0.0,0.0,0.02586206896551724,0.034482758620689655,6.044251888,54.56,4570.4061299999985,6,0.197443953,2.14594,2008-Nov-06,NVDA
All right So there should be some NII pickup in {DATE} from those moves I would assume,2,17,1,0.0,0.0,0.058823529411764705,0.0,0.0,3.901153486,54.56,13015.5828,8,0.765226172,1.53894,2008-Nov-06,PCG
That 's very helpful And then just last quick housekeeping question here It looks like your guidance {DATE} versus where it was {DATE} it seems like you 're getting a little bit of benefit from currency but it looks like your it looks like that benefit yields has n't changed costs Is that how I should think about that or is that just a rounding thing,4,66,1,0.0,0.0,0.015151515151515152,0.030303030303030304,0.015151515151515152,6.134076184,54.56,6488.3847700000015,11,0.334674654,0.14743,2008-Nov-06,NDAQ
Okay that 's helpful David Santee did the {PERCENT} of net effective rent you recorded is that a lease over lease number or a blended number in {DATE} And if not what was the actual rent change on leases signed in {DATE},3,42,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.023809523809523808,0.0,6.687922165,54.56,11289.05094,8,0.446938725,0.8416299999999999,2008-Nov-06,WMB
Jon Moshe is it fair to assume that for growth in your {DATE} and {DATE} that you are depending on the FD LTE deployment to take off And if yes how should we think about the number of base stations that could be deployed in {DATE} for FD LTE,2,49,1,0.0,0.04081632653061224,0.061224489795918366,0.0,0.0,6.687922165,54.56,11289.05094,8,0.446938725,0.8416299999999999,2008-Nov-06,WMB
And as we think about the reserve levels going forward should we think of them being closer to charge offs or you start building a little bit or,1,28,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.75885274,54.56,11171.57012,8,0.596878095,0.78098,2008-Nov-06,SE^B17
Hi good {TIME} everybody it 's actually Dave Clair in for Bill So the first question for me I was hoping to get an update on the state of the Chinese adoption of any T testing And then is this going to be a national rollout in China or is the province by province,3,54,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.018518518518518517,0.018518518518518517,4.75885274,54.56,11171.57012,8,0.596878095,0.78098,2008-Nov-06,SE^B17
Just a quick question Ron on whether you guys have seen any improvement in the outlook for pricing whether it be or second half specifically North America,1,27,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037037037037037035,0.037037037037037035,4.085267452,63.68,10813.66709,8,0.79098104,1.7037,2008-Nov-07,EIX
Okay Well let 's take EPD because I think that is probably the business where there is probably the biggest range of views on the growth profile of that business And if you look at it this quarter and then what you are expecting over the balance of {DATE} you 've got your emerging markets piece which is posting good growth not double digits but pretty close And then you 've got your rest of Europe which has been declining and it has been a drag So if EPD gets better over the balance of {DATE} is that because you start to lap some of those cuts that occurred in Europe {DATE} or is it because emerging markets accelerates,5,119,1,0.0,0.0,0.01680672268907563,0.01680672268907563,0.01680672268907563,4.085267452,63.68,10813.66709,8,0.79098104,1.7037,2008-Nov-07,EIX

Great thanks for to my question Rick just a follow up on the last question Is the mix of architecture types that are going through the foundry big die consumer chips et cetera is that a material factor in some of the yield issues or is it more around the node transition and less about particular architectures be it graphics or processors et cetera,3,64,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.015625,0.03125,4.796906223,59.98,3622.2792,6,0.31583546,1.35414,2008-Nov-11,ROK
And can you remind us how you guys target the core G&A growth excluding the options Is that still expected to be some percentage of sales growth or how do you guys think about that now,2,36,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.796906223,59.98,3622.2792,6,0.31583546,1.35414,2008-Nov-11,ROK
Okay great And just I do n't want to belabor this point but on the Gulf Coast segment you did mention LLS specifically but did n't mention Maya or heavier grade crudes as much Was the miss in the Gulf Coast really just an LLS driven phenomenon or did you feel some of the impact of tight heavy light spreads in {DATE} And going forward into {DATE} do you feel as though maybe some of the pressure that you felt in the Gulf Coast around LLS will ease as we 've seen heavy spreads widen out in {DATE},4,98,1,0.0,0.01020408163265306,0.01020408163265306,0.01020408163265306,0.01020408163265306,8.045462097,61.44,1837.26208,4,0.661891135,0.15994,2008-Nov-12,CXO
It makes sense On the aftermarket side obviously healthy growth there Comps were a little bit easier but just curious if there 's any changing or shifting dynamic there in terms of your ability to go out and capture non Flowserve aftermarket business or conversely if you 're seeing any increased competition of folks trying to come in and capture your stuff,3,62,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.016129032258064516,0.0,5.0758522180000005,66.46,2550.82347,9,0.17716899100000005,0.119,2008-Nov-13,URBN
Then just lastly with valuations getting cheaper in the market does that change the pace of maybe some of the M&A discussions,1,22,1,0.0,0.045454545454545456,0.045454545454545456,0.0,0.0,5.0758522180000005,66.46,2550.82347,9,0.17716899100000005,0.119,2008-Nov-13,URBN
Okay That 's helpful But then on the Santa Fe side you had a nice jump and certainly the pricing there helps and the volume growth but that 's an acceleration from the pace of margin gains you had {DATE} Was there anything unusual in {DATE} or what would help drive some of that,4,54,1,0.0,0.0,0.018518518518518517,0.018518518518518517,0.0,4.505375979,66.46,8792.560590000001,9,0.450214381,1.48643,2008-Nov-13,KSS
I learned from Matt actually You talked about inventory levels and you mentioned it was mostly in television This is basically planned right We 're not looking at softer sales in the categories That 's not part of the question but I just wanted to follow up on what Greg just said,5,52,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.019230769230769232,4.505375979,66.46,8792.560590000001,9,0.450214381,1.48643,2008-Nov-13,KSS
And then just a quick last question just to follow up I think you said in your comments Joe that there was no material prior period reserve development I believe {DATE} when you guys were still disclosing it the commercial number was {MONEY} Should we assume that it was a similar amount {DATE} or did you mean to say there was no amount {DATE},4,64,1,0.0,0.0,0.03125,0.0,0.03125,5.060900548999999,66.31,24926.35374,9,0.34770661700000005,0.2095,2008-Nov-17,TGT
Okay And the second question I 've got is have you been able to do some postmortems so to speak on we 're using {CARDINAL} shot over wells that have not been particularly good have you been able to determine what makes those areas and what has made those wells not good and thereby come up with a solution to that problem,3,62,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06451612903225806,0.03225806451612903,3.815662775,67.64,3296.62788,9,0.268502246,1.0982,2008-Nov-19,ROST
Thanks very much I have {CARDINAL} questions First for Jim some speculate that you may be interested in selling your Computeck and/or your nutritional businesses and I was wondering if you could remind us on your strategic importance of the businesses strategy with regards to overall diversification to the core pharma business Secondly for Elliot I was wondering if you could just clarify your Saxagliptin exposure in humans is obviously very high relative to what you expect a normal dose to be Can you tell us if you 've seen any edema in any of the studies in humans or monkeys that higher exposure,5,104,1,0.0,0.028846153846153848,0.057692307692307696,0.0,0.009615384615384616,3.815662775,67.64,3296.62788,9,0.268502246,1.0982,2008-Nov-19,ROST

Good {TIME} guys {DATE} Nick on the last call you had pointed out that there was downside risk to your guidance in the event of continued general economic slowdown I notice you did n't make that statement at all with this guidance Should we take that as implicit in your guidance or are you just feeling confident enough about {DATE} based on what you 're seeing now that that kind of goes away,5,73,1,0.0,0.0,0.0136986301369863,0.0273972602739726,0.0136986301369863,4.944594704,74.26,4041.52154,6,0.130012151,2.75539,2008-Nov-20,ADSK
Okay and I will take a look at the offering memorandum more closely but is that something like do you have interaction with the body or is this something they do unilaterally,1,32,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.946182511,80.86,1182.4668800000004,9,1.080979299,1.90921,2008-Nov-21,FL
Okay Turning to {CARDINAL} other topic there was some talk {DATE} {CARDINAL} Avenue raising distressed fund at some point in {DATE} Do you think that 's still on the table and would that have the same economic to AMG as the rest of their business,3,45,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.022222222222222223,4.946182511,80.86,1182.4668800000004,9,1.080979299,1.90921,2008-Nov-21,FL

Thanks Hey Steve and Bev Just {CARDINAL} follow up on the provision question Obviously grew loans again very strong {DATE} by {MONEY} So just wondering as you do think about reserve builds and going forward can you help us think about how this {DATE} 's provision was broken out between loan growth versus internal credit migration,5,56,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.017857142857142856,0.03571428571428571,2.578865309,72.67,13091.62023,1,0.129099209,0.52546,2008-Nov-24,CPB
Okay And within your credit agreement EBITDA I believe you can add back start up costs Is that the majority of what What we might not see in your press release,4,31,1,0.0,0.03225806451612903,0.06451612903225806,0.0,0.0,3.501332775,64.7,3468.168,9,0.393021069,2.50465,2008-Nov-25,DLTR

Mike I guess the {CARDINAL} quick question that I have for you is on bad debt expense I think you gave us {MONEY} I think {DATE} you said {MONEY} clearly up from there Is there a number that you 're thinking about for {DATE} now in these expectations,3,48,1,0.020833333333333332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041666666666666664,5.360494814,49.84,14652.15671,12,1.158507734,1.86359,2008-Dec-18,CCL
Is the environment more susceptible or more advantageous for you to do such a thing or is it just steady state and that 's really not an option,1,28,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03571428571428571,0.03571428571428571,4.23809595,47.34,3902.20552,1,0.524209138,4.1119,2008-Dec-19,CTAS
Right that 's shorter haul than going to Mobile I 've got that Final question the incentive comp accrual of {CARDINAL} is that the level of incentive comp that should have occurred given what happened or might there have been some excess incentive accrual {DATE} just because the numbers were so good,3,52,1,0.0,0.019230769230769232,0.019230769230769232,0.019230769230769232,0.019230769230769232,6.512188127000001,44.93,2371.98461,6,0.279512651,5.69914,2008-Dec-22,RHT
Hi thanks for taking the question I thought I would start off you talked on the call about focusing on sales in the GYN market does this open the door for more interaction at the patient level possibly direct to consumer type of marketing,2,44,1,0.0,0.022727272727272728,0.022727272727272728,0.0,0.022727272727272728,4.898420774,39.08,1448.3456,9,0.342746839,1.26918,2009-Jan-06,AYI
And then just following and then concluding on late cycle products I mean whether it 's a little bit at process or in other markets are there examples of where you 've really started to see a stabilization or there 's still declines that you 're fighting through commercial construction being I guess the biggest example,4,56,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.017857142857142856,0.03571428571428571,8.76137607,39.08,16735.01051,5,0.130272348,1.33348,2009-Jan-06,MOS
Okay Then just as a follow up to that as you look at your export business are you still pretty optimistic that we 'll maintain these kind of levels based on the short protein supplies that you 're seeing in global markets,2,42,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.023809523809523808,0.0,5.831299629,38.56,40251.45202,5,0.15281583599999998,5.46517,2009-Jan-07,MON
And can you quantify the SG&A opportunity you see in Denver perhaps tell us where the curb facilities are operating at and over what time period do you think you get them down to levels you see across your business,2,40,1,0.0,0.025,0.025,0.025,0.0,5.831299629,38.56,40251.45202,5,0.15281583599999998,5.46517,2009-Jan-07,MON

Thanks If I can ask {CARDINAL} more questions of clarification Does the expansion into the emerging markets is that a benefit or a headwind to operating margin or it 's does n't make a difference at all,3,37,1,0.0,0.0,0.02702702702702703,0.02702702702702703,0.02702702702702703,5.755170933,49.14,3849.582,6,0.328723935,8.85656,2009-Jan-15,APH
Okay And just if I look back at {DATE} it 's pretty amazing because there was never other than {DATE} of {DATE} there was never {DATE} that fell this much So during the financial crisis it fell {PERCENT} Here we fell {PERCENT} It begs the question do you feel like we 're in a recession or going into a recession,5,60,1,0.03333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06666666666666667,5.539141242,51.0,10142.994,3,0.527544338,1.54315,2009-Jan-16,JCI^I16

So just quickly on SG&A expense should we expect you 've got fewer stores opening in the back half Should we expect that the growth rate in SG&A could go back to the single digits or do you think we 'll stay at this elevated level for the rest of {DATE},2,51,1,0.0,0.0196078431372549,0.0196078431372549,0.0,0.0,6.391146944,46.11,15701.49155,11,0.641659518,0.6744899999999999,2009-Jan-20,STT

Rick I appreciate the color on some of the USIS wins especially in Social Security and CMS When you combine the tailwind and the momentum you 've got there with the anniversary of some of these faster growing acquisitions it strikes me that at least maybe the high end of {PERCENT} core non mortgage organic is a reasonable expectation for {DATE} Could you just kind of comment on that,3,69,1,0.0,0.028985507246376812,0.028985507246376812,0.0,0.0,6.4271710660000005,56.65,9807.94359,11,0.4199062120000001,5.00462,2009-Jan-21,NTRS
Thank you I guess my first question is if you take {PERCENT} and the opportunities that are not included in that what do you think {PERCENT} could move to Could it move up {CARDINAL} basis points or just What type of incremental do you see as potential opportunity,5,48,1,0.0,0.041666666666666664,0.041666666666666664,0.041666666666666664,0.020833333333333332,6.4271710660000005,56.65,9807.94359,11,0.4199062120000001,5.00462,2009-Jan-21,NTRS
Terrific And then just a question on G&A overall general and administrative expenses overall for the Company I think you mentioned in a couple of segments that expense levels were a little bit elevated in {DATE} Is there any reason we should expect that in those couple of instances Life Planner a few other places should we trend from this level Or is some of that IP spending and other spending {CARDINAL} off,5,73,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0136986301369863,4.141552478,56.65,69641.3228,6,0.214970945,4.506869999999998,2009-Jan-21,AAPL
Okay So I understand why processing plants in the SCOOP and Powder River would get pushed out but I was a little surprised that Demicks Lake was also in there just given McKenzie County has the lowest breakevens in the Bakken Can you talk about the slowdown you are seeing and even the sweet spots and what are the utilizations at Garden Creek and State Line plants Are they full or is there some capacity left there to accommodate any volumes that would have gone to Demicks Lake,6,88,1,0.011363636363636364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.011363636363636364,3.664546338,56.65,46922.40576,3,0.314594827,2.36063,2009-Jan-21,UTX
Okay Lastly just big picture we 've seen a lot of growth or a lot of headlines in the student loan refinance industry either from these new peer to peer lenders or banks that have gotten into the space a little more meaningfully I know we 've seen consolidations to third parties pick up a little bit in your FFELP portfolio Can you talk about your thoughts there and whether you would contemplate some sort of refi product at this point to capture some of those consolidations or how you 're thinking about that space,4,95,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.664546338,56.65,46922.40576,3,0.314594827,2.36063,2009-Jan-21,UTX
Okay And my other question is just on there 's some recent story that you might be looking to sell your Texas merchant assets I do n't know if you could talk about that But maybe more if you can at a high level how much are you looking at maybe monetizing some assets within the near business I guess assets that are less contracted,4,65,1,0.0,0.06153846153846154,0.06153846153846154,0.0,0.015384615384615385,3.664546338,56.65,46922.40576,3,0.314594827,2.36063,2009-Jan-21,UTX
I do n't like to cheerlead but {DATE} The question is regarding guidance With regard to your usual pattern Peter you seem to be more conservative usually You guided up versus the Street by quite a bit to {MONEY} maybe arguably {MONEY} better What are you seeing that allows you to be so confident in the face of some people being worried about the economy at this time,5,68,1,0.0,0.014705882352941176,0.014705882352941176,0.029411764705882353,0.014705882352941176,4.88685377,56.65,11032.5544,5,0.394584658,0.15672,2009-Jan-21,APD
As a follow up we 've had some huge margin declines in {DATE} big volumes Can we look for get some guidance of what margin or profitability numbers can look like in the segment for for {DATE} maybe on a more stable basis as opposed to the sharp impact that we 're seeing in {DATE},2,55,1,0.0,0.01818181818181818,0.01818181818181818,0.03636363636363636,0.03636363636363636,4.312588705,56.65,10997.79572,12,1.126385873,0.54468,2009-Jan-21,CSX
Hi Thank you and good {TIME} I wanted to follow up Safra and Mark you guys mentioned that in your comments to John about how you 've been hiring aggressively and I think you mentioned you 've hired {CARDINAL} people since {DATE} in your press release Can you talk about Safra how you think about balancing kind of your EPS goals And I 'm not talking about {DATE} but just as you look going forward out over {DATE} or {DATE} how do you think about balancing your EPS goals with the demand opportunity you see in front of you based on this based on the pipeline and the product lineup that you have,5,113,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.017699115044247787,0.0,4.312588705,56.65,10997.79572,12,1.126385873,0.54468,2009-Jan-21,CSX
Okay and then my follow up relates to the EBIT margin for drug distribution So Mike even when ex the generic benefit that you highlighted as the {CARDINAL} time I 've seen some pretty meaningful expansion both {DATE} I think we calculate {CARDINAL} basis points {DATE} if you exclude that generic benefit and also {DATE} I think So can you just help us sort through it How did Harvard Drug maybe perform and how did they contribute on a sequential basis because what I 'm thinking what was {DATE} in {DATE} So if you can just help us understand the moving parts that helped drive that margin expansion,6,108,1,0.0,0.009259259259259259,0.009259259259259259,0.018518518518518517,0.0,4.003145548,56.65,1699.7202,6,0.388412354,0.58103,2009-Jan-21,FFIV
Good {TIME} Sam I was wondering if you could just if possible break out roughly the percentages where some of the cost initiatives are going to be {DATE} sort of in costs of goods sold SG&A just for modeling purposes,2,40,1,0.0,0.05,0.075,0.025,0.025,4.003145548,56.65,1699.7202,6,0.388412354,0.58103,2009-Jan-21,FFIV
And just the last question I have you had highlighted the weather benefits the margin rate As that begins to normalize what would be the impact on margin or in other words how much would you guesstimate was the benefit in,2,41,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.024390243902439025,0.024390243902439025,4.003145548,56.65,1699.7202,6,0.388412354,0.58103,2009-Jan-21,FFIV
So you obviously do not recognize the revenue after {DATE} Do you recognize the costs and expenses related to that Is that correct,3,23,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.003145548,56.65,1699.7202,6,0.388412354,0.58103,2009-Jan-21,FFIV
On the deployment of the smart meter system the {CARDINAL} customer deployment did you say you will actually get a return on capital while that {MONEY} is being depreciated over the various lifetimes,1,33,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.087547353,46.42,172299.1109,6,0.144138484,1.27783,2009-Jan-22,MSFT
Raymond James You had noted that gross margin rates and commercial have solidified and then further the Company achieved a very nice increase in gross margin rate despite very strong sales in commercial Darren are we at the point where gross margins in the commercial segment are no longer at a disadvantage to the do it yourself category,3,58,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05172413793103448,0.017241379310344827,4.087547353,46.42,172299.1109,6,0.144138484,1.27783,2009-Jan-22,MSFT

In terms of your raw materials do you expect your raw materials to be flat or down {DATE},1,18,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.201855582,46.42,6478.70884,9,0.198616691,1.16254,2009-Jan-22,SHW

Okay so just a follow up assume at this point in time you are capitalizing a lower cost into your inventory At what point would you expect to see that relief flow through your P&L Would that be by {DATE} or it could be {DATE},4,45,1,0.0,0.022222222222222223,0.044444444444444446,0.0,0.0,5.449934567000001,46.42,10883.9939,11,0.843591984,0.27873000000000003,2009-Jan-22,BBT
Okay And my last one just relates to the acquisitions John you mentioned acquisition opportunities Any particular areas disciplines regions of particular interest or focus,4,25,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04,0.0,4.646738911,46.42,34968.5543,8,0.436775961,1.3473,2009-Jan-22,EXC
Thank you {CARDINAL} last question and I 'll hop off If we assume best case results from the Eagle Ford which hope might get into a development case would that increase your willingness or your desire to sell international assets,3,40,1,0.025,0.025,0.05,0.025,0.025,9.089999746,46.42,1687.52738,11,1.907798073,23.76073,2009-Jan-22,HBAN
Have you seen that CPM gap which I assume is still there between your networks and broadcast have you seen that narrow over time,1,24,1,0.0,0.0,0.041666666666666664,0.0,0.0,9.089999746,46.42,1687.52738,11,1.907798073,23.76073,2009-Jan-22,HBAN

Okay and so as we look from your {DATE} run rate X the {MONEY} are there any other incremental costs in the fluid segment you need to absorb as we go through {DATE},1,33,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.091965195,47.29,44581.18136,4,0.333602471,0.21171,2009-Jan-23,SLB

All right And I guess just {CARDINAL} more quick ones for me Just an outlook on operating margins there was obviously some decent leverage in {DATE} {DATE} How do we think about margins going forward,4,35,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.135198606,47.27,19433.41075,6,0.473202521,2.05884,2009-Jan-26,TXN
The special dividend given the history that you guys have had with that does that sort of would that push you to push closings into {DATE} or something like that to avoid that Or do special dividends at this point not really bother you {CARDINAL} way or the other,2,49,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02040816326530612,5.667424926,47.27,18558.272,11,0.5502834839999999,0.05561,2009-Jan-26,AXP
{CARDINAL} quick follow up on the electric rate case Given Fermi securitization roll off of {MONEY} in {DATE} do you think it is possible for this net in effect to fully offset your CapEx plan between now and then to execute a near {PERCENT} customer bill increase rate case,2,49,1,0.0,0.02040816326530612,0.02040816326530612,0.0,0.0,3.283504106,47.27,16411.9735,6,0.544209863,1.5957,2009-Jan-26,DHR
Got it And I know it 's a bit early yet but just to help us guide us a little What 's free cash flow levels or generation potential for {DATE} is there any sort of framework you can give us at this point of how you 're thinking about that and how we should,3,55,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.042121577,47.27,9111.42064,10,0.383965728,4.14804,2009-Jan-26,DGX
And has this also affected management training and the way that folks move up throughout the organization or is that a separate or would that be separate from this initiative,1,30,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.042121577,47.27,9111.42064,10,0.383965728,4.14804,2009-Jan-26,DGX
Great And then second one just relates to the DRI strategy So when I understand the DRI plant will in part probably display some pig iron that you 're currently bringing in from overseas or elsewhere and then perhaps some of it will displace some prime scrap you 're purchasing domestically And those accomplish different things and I wanted to see if I can get a sense of initially at least when you bring the second plan up is that mostly going to be a pig iron offset,4,88,1,0.0,0.011363636363636364,0.022727272727272728,0.022727272727272728,0.011363636363636364,3.042121577,47.27,9111.42064,10,0.383965728,4.14804,2009-Jan-26,DGX

Okay in {DATE} that 's sort of the same dynamic potentially with international being a little bit maybe softer And then the domestic side continuing to do what is been doing,2,31,1,0.0,0.03225806451612903,0.03225806451612903,0.0,0.0,3.154478853,45.69,15971.7566,10,0.351599944,0.17140999999999998,2009-Jan-27,SYK
{CARDINAL} more if I can a follow up The electric utility CapEx came down by {MONEY} compared to the EEI deck Is that just related to the actual purchase price from Renaissance Or are there any other changes to {DATE} of the longer term outlook,4,45,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.262968725,45.69,13339.0136,4,1.770952031,0.72492,2009-Jan-27,VLO

Thank you very much Hi good job on {DATE} guys My question is related to pricing strategy and particularly in the non value added products Does the balance of price versus share change at all in an economic recession as your customers IRRs on their planned projects are perhaps harder to achieve and your competitors are likely to get weaker Does that balance do you look at that a little different given the macroenvironment,5,74,1,0.0,0.013513513513513514,0.013513513513513514,0.02702702702702703,0.04054054054054054,3.809810595,45.69,88026.59916,7,0.555332696,0.34083,2009-Jan-27,VZ
Thank you My question has to do with the macro environment You put up numbers here in {DATE} that were obviously better than we anticipated and you too and also you gave guidance here that actually looks pretty good better than I think we anticipated out there out here Just curious is there truly a recovery happening in a meaningful way or is Oracle I 'm trying to get a gauge as to whether or not what 's happening out there has more to do with Oracle 's execution which is at least over {DATE} been head and shoulders above many of your competitors or is this a rising tide that may be lifting all ships at least in {DATE} and into the near future,5,125,1,0.0,0.008,0.024,0.024,0.008,3.4966347310000003,45.69,10903.68576,10,0.294157004,1.7968,2009-Jan-27,STJ^A17

Okay but the Groupons the Zappos those guys are already big enough where they would have to pay the sales tax I 'm thinking about a small start up selling whatever wares for them up it is costly that is why the {MONEY} just seems very low {MONEY} seems a bit more appropriate so,3,54,1,0.0,0.0,0.037037037037037035,0.0,0.018518518518518517,5.801982677000001,45.69,2052.2925,5,0.562193731,1.14535,2009-Jan-27,ALB
And also interesting when you look broadly at the whole business you 've done quite a bit of restructuring over {DATE} it looks like it 's been very successful in terms of delivering better margins getting cost down But now when you look ahead you 've gotten some very encouraging orders in {DATE} and do you see a point here where you 're transitioning to really a different way to think about the Company in terms of more growth potentially less restructuring because you may not need to get your fixed cost base down much more When can you get comfortable there,3,102,1,0.0,0.00980392156862745,0.00980392156862745,0.029411764705882353,0.0196078431372549,5.801982677000001,45.69,2052.2925,5,0.562193731,1.14535,2009-Jan-27,ALB

So is it fair to say then you 're blaming it mostly or primarily on logistics and really there 's not much competitive action happening,1,25,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.737544882999999,45.69,6717.625140000001,12,0.358386558,1.4674,2009-Jan-27,DAL

Okay So what are you saying We should n't be too worried from a fixed cost deleveraging respect that when you made a lot of your initial plans you were a {MONEY} company and now you guys are looking like a {MONEY} company,3,43,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.397999972,42.25,3002.1651,6,0.34855819,4.0106199999999985,2009-Jan-28,WDC

Thank you Good {TIME} Just a couple of questions First can you give us a little color on the dynamic for gross margin improvement sequentially Is it the effect of the restructuring or do you have your own aerial density changes going on that is benefiting the cogs line,5,49,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061224489795918366,0.04081632653061224,4.044094149,42.25,13941.00435,12,0.927326121,0.61605,2009-Jan-28,NSC
Hi Mark just go back to the old story about the all the list outs you are doing all the good talents out there is private equity at all on the radar screen at this time,1,36,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.027777777777777776,0.0,4.044094149,42.25,13941.00435,12,0.927326121,0.61605,2009-Jan-28,NSC
Great Thing {CARDINAL} quick another quick question in your IRRs what 's your assumption on cash operating expenses LOE and gathering transportation,4,22,1,0.0,0.0,0.045454545454545456,0.045454545454545456,0.045454545454545456,4.044094149,42.25,13941.00435,12,0.927326121,0.61605,2009-Jan-28,NSC
Oh great Thanks And then I guess my second question pertains to Tokyo and we have all heard some pretty heated views about JAL and I 'm sure you folks have strong views as well I would like to come at it slightly differently If I 'm not mistaken Delta serves {CARDINAL} destinations from the hub so obviously gets some attractive connecting fees So my question is how important is it to have that connecting traffic to make the routes from Japan work and I guess what I 'm getting at is whether the local traffic is rich enough to support the routes on their own,9,106,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02830188679245283,0.02830188679245283,4.413853817,42.25,4213.3104,6,0.451908859,0.91261,2009-Jan-28,CTXS

And then Jimmy can I just ask you now of course having known where you are in {DATE} which you said you came exactly around your target and with decoupling and with the BLRA and with if I 'm right what you tell us on slide {CARDINAL} there are no regulatory things to do in {DATE} Except for the BLRA filing Am I right There 's no regulatory rate case going on as part of the process,4,77,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.405623846,42.25,864.69,9,0.155281873,0.93983,2009-Jan-28,HBI
Yes It does n't necessarily fill in the details but so will the leasehold spending be concentrated in {DATE} versus the balance of {DATE},2,24,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.405623846,42.25,864.69,9,0.155281873,0.93983,2009-Jan-28,HBI
Hey guys Good {TIME} Thanks for taking my question I was going to ask on the automotive side just on following up on whether if I could for a moment Historically when you guys have seen perhaps a bit more moderate temperatures in {DATE} would you say that that potentially could have a slowing effect as we get into {DATE} because there may not be as much brakeage or is that sort of premature to speculate on,5,77,1,0.0,0.05194805194805195,0.06493506493506493,0.012987012987012988,0.03896103896103896,7.405623846,42.25,864.69,9,0.155281873,0.93983,2009-Jan-28,HBI
And then David are you getting any pushback on physician misconceptions of the disease or do you feel like you 've addressed a lot of that part of the story,1,30,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.405623846,42.25,864.69,9,0.155281873,0.93983,2009-Jan-28,HBI
That 's very helpful And then just a quick follow up for Kathee I know you do a pretty thorough job looking at pricing on a regular basis Any comments on what you 're seeing in the environment especially in the more consumables area,4,44,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.341556021000001,42.25,2804.47296,3,0.393015806,2.66184,2009-Jan-28,LRCX
Okay And then overall for the metal beverage Americas Asia business it looks like operating profit was essentially flat in {DATE} You had said before that you thought you could get operating earnings up somewhere in {PERCENT} range for this segment for {DATE} How are you feeling about that right now And do you think you can get there with improvement in {DATE},5,63,1,0.0,0.015873015873015872,0.031746031746031744,0.015873015873015872,0.0,3.626358007,39.66,17839.5887,3,0.44461184,3.678630000000001,2009-Jan-29,ITW
That 's helpful Just as a follow up are you surprised maybe a little frustrated from a competitive standpoint that some of your competitors at least from what we 're seeing out there are doing something or made maybe a different decision in terms of whether to spend behind marketing or drop price down a little bit,2,57,1,0.0,0.03508771929824561,0.03508771929824561,0.0,0.017543859649122806,5.708432909,39.66,9194.71095,4,0.846173519,0.23858,2009-Jan-29,MUR
Okay Are there any kind of mix issues we should be aware of that could be impacting just margins in general going forward Aside from just the headline metal margin number that we should be thinking about,3,37,1,0.0,0.02702702702702703,0.02702702702702703,0.0,0.0,5.708432909,39.66,9194.71095,4,0.846173519,0.23858,2009-Jan-29,MUR
Okay And then just in general in terms of resolution of the San Bruno schedule and everything we 've noticed that there has been some legislative inquiry and sort of I guess questions about the CPUC in general Do you see that as having any impact just in general as you guys know California is scheduling seems to be kind of a moving target And I 'm just sort of wondering if there is any potential here for slippage as a result of some of these issues that have been brought up in the media and what have you How should we think about that,5,105,1,0.0,0.0,0.009523809523809525,0.0,0.02857142857142857,6.087712485,39.66,2553.012,3,0.595637404,4.03178,2009-Jan-29,NWL
Maybe you could is there anything you can highlight that has changed in {DATE} in terms of learnings from the next gen store that you 've sort of rolled out to the older stores,1,34,1,0.0,0.058823529411764705,0.058823529411764705,0.0,0.0,6.087712485,39.66,2553.012,3,0.595637404,4.03178,2009-Jan-29,NWL
I guess the question is how often do you sort of review it Because it 's been you 've had the arrow in the quiver for a while in terms of your commentary so I 'm just curious are we getting closer to sort of that or do you still think that the organic investments and opportunity are going to outweigh it for the foreseeable future,2,66,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.015151515151515152,0.015151515151515152,3.992259054,39.66,3475.25814,6,0.175304187,1.88591,2009-Jan-29,MCHP
Thanks Thank you very much I appreciate that The My question is on the dividend I know that you raised the dividend above the long term {PERCENT} aspiration {DATE} Your payout ratio is still below what I would consider the peer group average although obviously you could slot different companies in and out of that And your cash profile looks pretty good relative to the way you 've portrayed it in your even in your updated release {DATE} Is there still a possibility over {DATE} that we might get {CARDINAL} or more sort of out of trend line dividend increases as you try to move back to an industry average payout,9,111,1,0.0,0.018018018018018018,0.02702702702702703,0.009009009009009009,0.009009009009009009,3.992259054,39.66,3475.25814,6,0.175304187,1.88591,2009-Jan-29,MCHP
Mike can you talk on multi progression for {DATE} Trying to get a sense on how {DATE} fared versus {DATE} and the strength of the order book exiting {DATE},2,29,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.034482758620689655,0.0,3.992259054,39.66,3475.25814,6,0.175304187,1.88591,2009-Jan-29,MCHP
Morning guys Wanted to follow up Oscar your comment about more to go in terms of rightsizing the network Just given the volumes and now the service level is improving is it possible ahead to start seeing some more material headcount reductions I do n't know {PERCENT} {PERCENT} {PERCENT} I do n't know Is that possible,5,56,1,0.0,0.03571428571428571,0.03571428571428571,0.017857142857142856,0.0,4.884591076,39.66,3459.9056100000007,6,0.420845926,1.5144799999999998,2009-Jan-29,KLAC
With inventories down {PERCENT} {DATE} and I know you spent some time explaining how you 're able to move some of that inventory should we expect to see further inventory declines as we go into the fiscal {CARDINAL},1,38,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02631578947368421,0.02631578947368421,4.884591076,39.66,3459.9056100000007,6,0.420845926,1.5144799999999998,2009-Jan-29,KLAC
Okay Great And then just secondly the OtisMed slight pushout there Any sense of whether this is related to the warning letter trend we saw with other manufacturers and patient specific instruments or just a little more time needed specifically with the OtisMed {CARDINAL},4,44,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.022727272727272728,0.022727272727272728,2.58157232,39.66,8392.72581,8,1.171561247,1.00991,2009-Jan-29,XEL
And then Frank can you talk about specifically in the process group of businesses a little more granularity on end market trends and where you see relative strength where you are seeing the more pronounced weakness,1,36,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.027777777777777776,0.027777777777777776,6.771068913,39.66,3206.5901,3,0.8037034959999999,1.11257,2009-Jan-29,TXT
And then if we go back you talked about the majority of your pricing was true pricing power not mix shift Could you give us a little more color on that And just what you 're seeing on the cost side so we can understand what type of magnitude you have on pricing power versus cost inflation,3,57,1,0.0,0.017543859649122806,0.017543859649122806,0.0,0.0,4.369953707,39.66,1773.9671399999993,6,0.973367614,2.48277,2009-Jan-29,PKI
Okay Then secondly your revenues were down {PERCENT} in {DATE} but your SG&A costs were down {PERCENT} and there is an emphasis on Dow on cost reduction Are you satisfied with that number or could you have done better Or do you see SG&A as relatively high versus the sales decrease,4,51,1,0.0,0.0196078431372549,0.0196078431372549,0.0392156862745098,0.0,7.174494124,39.66,1934.86266,12,2.324780845,1.0234,2009-Jan-29,RCL
Okay Great And then the US perm growth rate accelerating a bit is there anything different in the market that you 're seeing or would you attribute to investments in headcount or is it just lumpiness that we 're over analyzing maybe if we look at the growth rates versus {DATE},3,51,1,0.0,0.0196078431372549,0.0196078431372549,0.0196078431372549,0.0,7.174494124,39.66,1934.86266,12,2.324780845,1.0234,2009-Jan-29,RCL
I know most of your plan is pretty well set as far as the rigs you mentioned in the Perm added I guess just my question is if you have some of the success over in the Eagle Ford particularly with some of this Upper Eagle Ford potential any thoughts about would that change any plans for potentially in {DATE} or are you pretty well set now with the {CARDINAL} rigs coming on in the Perm and what you have going on in the Eagle Ford irrespective of results,2,89,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.011235955056179775,0.011235955056179775,2.771893871,39.66,20566.70789,6,0.444980839,3.04795,2009-Jan-29,RTN
Hi this is actually Monica Dichenzo for Alexia A question regarding the buybacks We saw that they picked up a little bit in versus {DATE} I 'm just wondering should we expect this pace to continue through {DATE} where the stock is And given your comments earlier about acquisition prices coming more in line with what you are looking for how are you balancing buybacks versus acquisitions going forward,5,69,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.014492753623188406,2.771893871,39.66,20566.70789,6,0.444980839,3.04795,2009-Jan-29,RTN
Well done Just a couple things Are you seeing any regional difference in the comps or the regions sort of uniform in terms of their performance in the same store base,3,31,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.771893871,39.66,20566.70789,6,0.444980839,3.04795,2009-Jan-29,RTN

In terms of like OE and RONA how are you guys using those metrics to look at your manufacturing throughput to make sure you are doing the right job at the right plant,1,33,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.121319897,39.66,21583.43988,6,0.121743187,2.67852,2009-Jan-29,AMZN
Sure And just a quick follow up on the share purchases should we expect the share repurchase activity to accelerate in the face of the cyclical weakness,2,27,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037037037037037035,2.593769291,39.66,20748.06029,8,0.6802675509999999,1.7683799999999998,2009-Jan-29,D

Okay All right Great And just on the acquisition front you mentioned that the pipeline in North America remains fairly consistent above {MONEY} I 'm curious are you getting a sense that there may be potentially some privately owned companies that are becoming increasingly willing to come to the bargaining table given the prospects of capital gains tax rules may change in the next administration are you getting a sense that there is more interest in potentially doing deals,5,79,1,0.0,0.02531645569620253,0.02531645569620253,0.02531645569620253,0.0,2.593769291,39.66,20748.06029,8,0.6802675509999999,1.7683799999999998,2009-Jan-29,D

The second question was how many stores in Germany do you need to start to break even,1,17,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11764705882352941,5.086691154,39.66,4957.6044299999985,8,0.6449329189999999,3.34245,2009-Jan-29,EQT
Finally you called out cost Are you actually behind on price cost {DATE} so theoretically we have kind of a narrowing of that negative spread or are you just kind of thinking in aggregate obviously cost is downward pressure and there for we just naturally get some help,2,48,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041666666666666664,3.997894341,42.63,23727.79629,3,0.326955139,0.24857,2009-Jan-30,HON
Okay And then just {CARDINAL} other follow up On the higher free cash flow guidance in magnitude kind of what are the drivers of that higher free cash flow guidance What are the biggest drivers Is it less equipment sales or something else there,5,44,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.997894341,42.63,23727.79629,3,0.326955139,0.24857,2009-Jan-30,HON
I noticed that your days receivable seems to be contracting and of course one of the concerns that many people have in this environment is bad debt expense from customers being unable to pay We have had some we have seen some smaller companies reporting similar type experiences Are you making an effort to tighten your exposure to customers or is it basically business as usual,3,66,1,0.0,0.0,0.030303030303030304,0.0,0.045454545454545456,8.349622658,42.63,4438.68104,11,1.046506495,5.20667,2009-Jan-30,IVZ
On the cost side going back to raw materials for a moment The expectation had been coming out of or entering {DATE} {PERCENT} to {PERCENT} growth and then obviously high single digits was kind of the expectation Where did cost increase end up for {DATE} in total,3,47,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.70307968,42.63,9040.15364,2,0.513334541,0.20393,2009-Jan-30,PCAR
Okay And do you feel like I had also heard that there was some fragmentation of purchases that restaurants were chasing deals And were willing to sort of go anywhere to get those deals Are you seeing anything like that,5,40,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8.898357315,42.63,10333.01104,11,0.209368949,1.12111,2009-Jan-30,SPG

That was helpful Was there a meaningful change in headcount in {DATE} I mean if you look at {DATE} I think you said {CARDINAL} employees versus {CARDINAL} at {DATE} So I was wondering if that moved up {CARDINAL} versus {CARDINAL} and the impact of diesel costs that you would have absorbed,4,51,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.763437078,44.84,3691.45644,6,0.31583546,0.56814,2009-Feb-02,ROK
Thanks {CARDINAL} quick one for Mark When you think about {DATE} I know you 're not giving guidance on that but just wanted to talk about linearity of {DATE} When you look at year is there any reason to not expect normal seasonality with up from especially with assuming ships in and in down from based on normal seasonality and then up from And the reason I ask is if you look at current consensus numbers they assume revenues up in {DATE} but would you suggest should be down sequentially followed by an uptick in,5,95,1,0.0,0.010526315789473684,0.031578947368421054,0.0,0.0,4.763437078,44.84,3691.45644,6,0.31583546,0.56814,2009-Feb-02,ROK
Great Just a question quickly for Vikas How should we think about the FX impact for {DATE} just based on the guidance that you 've provided,3,26,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.038461538461538464,0.038461538461538464,4.386632996,45.52,3318.74798,6,0.269200321,7.959189999999999,2009-Feb-03,ILMN
And on the University wells I guess the IP wells that were put on artificial lift early I think Scott you 're saying that you might not do that in the future and that could be the reason why the wells are lower rate than say some of the other offsets that are on natural flow,1,56,1,0.0,0.03571428571428571,0.03571428571428571,0.0,0.0,2.327755592,45.52,3190.60316,10,0.286095182,1.50271,2009-Feb-03,EW
You stated that there were over {CARDINAL} bidders for the Campo Verde project Are you seeing new investors in the solar market and what are you seeing as the required returns for further investments in solar projects,2,37,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.327755592,45.52,3190.60316,10,0.286095182,1.50271,2009-Feb-03,EW
And then my follow up a week does n't pass without an article about the growing acceptance of prepaid debit cards I 'm just wondering how does that trend if it does impact the Asterisk Free product the {CARDINAL} grace product that you guys have and is that a threat at all to future growth,2,55,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01818181818181818,3.25403442,45.52,4960.738,6,0.550961952,0.60219,2009-Feb-03,FISV

I just had a follow up question on the maintenance CapEx Obviously it was {MONEY} in You addressed so many weather issues but if I go off your {DATE} guidance of {MONEY} does that imply I just want to get the arithmetic right that this actually jumps to {MONEY} over {DATE},3,51,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0196078431372549,4.076395318,43.06,1792.0968,3,0.566517511,0.05476,2009-Feb-04,SNA

Right Okay And then also David keeping you in the hot seat here regarding your overall net yield forecast thank you for the color You mentioned Australia as being an area of caution given the capacity growth that 's there Just wondering if you could give us more color on your thoughts on what you are seeing and thinking about Europe {DATE} because capacity is growing there While it 's mid single digits and it 's not an onerous number it is up a lot versus the steep decline in {DATE} So are you baking in any kind of conservatism for Europe and then also maybe regarding the economy there or how are you thinking about that,7,117,1,0.0,0.017094017094017096,0.017094017094017096,0.0,0.02564102564102564,8.591333782000001,43.06,4715.12032,11,1.0388171,0.39341,2009-Feb-04,UNM

Okay that makes sense Thanks And then can you I know you talked about some of the rollover numbers from acquisitions Can you just talk about the seasonality of revenues in those acquired companies and how that seasonality compares to Gallagher 's historical seasonality,4,44,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.248741955,43.06,1737.1044,4,2.730011741,1.53418,2009-Feb-04,PXD
Okay thanks A second question I 'm hearing again that any day this federal regulation is due for managed Medicaid and you 've talk about the rates in context of MLR floors in many states And I think {CARDINAL} of your competitors has been talking about cross subsidization of over earning with under earning segments What might you be expecting going forward and what are companies like you lobbying for with CMS,4,72,1,0.0,0.013888888888888888,0.013888888888888888,0.0,0.013888888888888888,7.248741955,43.06,1737.1044,4,2.730011741,1.53418,2009-Feb-04,PXD
Great And a bit of a follow up maybe to Christine 's question on industry M&A. I know that historically you normally do n't pursue aggressive M&A either in terms of paying a lot or hostile But if large peers are putting themselves up do you see absolute regulatory issues barring you from participating Or is that something that you can at least sharpen the pencil on to determine if maybe some individual large assets are better placed somewhere else but you can still participate in that process,6,88,1,0.0,0.022727272727272728,0.03409090909090909,0.022727272727272728,0.022727272727272728,8.466791439,43.85,6370.77866,11,0.58866594,0.08718,2009-Feb-05,EQR
{CARDINAL} last question Laurie if I might ask Both gold and copper revenues were lower in {DATE} than the average price in {DATE} Is that just a timing issue on gold and copper concentrate sales,3,35,1,0.0,0.02857142857142857,0.02857142857142857,0.0,0.02857142857142857,3.228142807,43.85,2191.0497,5,0.2451492,1.42588,2009-Feb-05,IFF

All right That 's helpful And then I know it 's kind of {DATE} but have you seen anything surprising from the EMB switchover that would suggest there are opportunities or risks from either the revenue or expense side,3,39,1,0.0,0.02564102564102564,0.05128205128205128,0.02564102564102564,0.0,3.3435492360000003,43.85,4079.07,10,0.394993056,0.28347,2009-Feb-05,XRAY
That 's helpful And then lastly maybe for Brian the Company has done a pretty good job of managing capital meaning buying back stock frankly over {DATE} And I 'm wondering my sense is that you historically have not been a big believer in buybacks But I 'm wondering with Marsh and given the strong cash flow what your feeling is on that,4,63,1,0.0,0.015873015873015872,0.015873015873015872,0.031746031746031744,0.0,3.3435492360000003,43.85,4079.07,10,0.394993056,0.28347,2009-Feb-05,XRAY
I 'm just tried to get a better understanding of what drove the payroll revenue growth result which was very very slightly worse than in {DATE} What I 'm trying to recognize that with a number of drivers that seem to show improvement If you look at checks per client if you look at the number of clients lost to bankruptcy if you look at the new client sales growth if you look at client attrition All of those numbers seem to improve or at least they were less bad yet your payroll revenue growth was essentially {DATE} growth number as {DATE} So is there something else that we 're not seeing in the drivers that sort of accounts for {DATE} growth number versus {DATE} and the overall payroll number,5,130,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.023076923076923078,0.038461538461538464,5.067991612,43.85,3752.33879,6,0.013898405,0.61334,2009-Feb-05,VRSN
And you just on cash what is your expectation for the use of cash {DATE} Do you need to keep {MONEY} on the balance sheet over the course of {DATE},2,30,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.9806403180000003,43.85,4239.63169,12,0.184182744,0.66146,2009-Feb-05,SRCL
Okay So the mix shift I 'm assuming PZ is going to be moving more fee based here given that you 're fairly call it conservative on your NGL margins does that change your thinking at all,3,37,1,0.0,0.0,0.02702702702702703,0.0,0.0,6.044975504,43.85,812.50189,6,0.68206495,1.80813,2009-Feb-05,SWKS
Then in terms of just the margins I think it talks about then pushing pricing with the average selling price up We 've heard lots of different thoughts from over the course of actually {DATE} here in terms of the earnings releases from different builders in terms of the thoughts on pushing price versus continuing to increase absorption at this point How are you balancing the {CARDINAL} right now,3,69,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.044975504,43.85,812.50189,6,0.68206495,1.80813,2009-Feb-05,SWKS
Great If I could get a follow up with Rob on the productivity side As you look toward a little bit less coming from yields and more of that improvement coming from productivity do you still see accelerating opportunities to continue to gain on the productivity side How do you look at that opportunity,4,54,1,0.0,0.018518518518518517,0.018518518518518517,0.09259259259259259,0.0,6.044975504,43.85,812.50189,6,0.68206495,1.80813,2009-Feb-05,SWKS

Okay yes What I 'm trying to get a sense of is just given the what seems to be the improving environment overall And David I understand things are moving in the right direction on the commercial and industrial The piece like residential for example is it getting more competitive for some reason than it has been over {DATE},6,59,1,0.0,0.0,0.01694915254237288,0.01694915254237288,0.0,5.803404395,43.85,2472.75964,11,0.587069262,4.28719,2009-Feb-05,TMK
Yes good {TIME} guys and thanks for taking the question I guess George could you maybe talk a little bit about gross to net synergies and the investments that you feel like the Company will need to make as you try to bring the {CARDINAL} businesses together I know the Walgreens executives have commented in the past that the IT infrastructure at Walgreens needs a little bit of work I think the same thing is safe to say needs work at Rite Aid I guess though as you try to think about gross synergies versus net synergies from your analysis is there any more color you can give us there,4,110,1,0.0,0.01818181818181818,0.01818181818181818,0.00909090909090909,0.00909090909090909,9.625335967,43.85,3581.5198,11,0.6746233429999999,2.63745,2009-Feb-05,KIM

And I know I 'm not looking for specific numbers but I guess I 'm expecting out of the contract given that we 've had this big lump sum payment I 'm expecting that the benefits that come out of that both directly from pension and then from the flexibility on the work rules I 'm expecting that manifests itself in better margins over time in domestic Am I thinking about that correctly,3,73,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0136986301369863,0.0,10.7590663,43.85,11115.48,11,1.052779128,7.891210000000001,2009-Feb-05,PRU
So just as a follow up any thoughts on where you could take the market share overall for the Company in {DATE} {DATE} and with the {CARDINAL} stores now up and running is there any details you can share with us on the new models investment requirements operating margins and ROI versus the total Company,1,55,1,0.0,0.01818181818181818,0.01818181818181818,0.0,0.0,10.7590663,43.85,11115.48,11,1.052779128,7.891210000000001,2009-Feb-05,PRU
Thanks very much My first question is related to one of the procedures that you did n't talk about and that 's head and neck surgery There was a notable training course at the international surgeon 's meeting {DATE} Is that on the radar as contributing significantly to procedure increases {DATE},4,51,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0196078431372549,10.7590663,43.85,11115.48,11,1.052779128,7.891210000000001,2009-Feb-05,PRU

We certainly can In terms of confining the manufacturing curtailments to {DATE} what is the likelihood that is achievable versus seeing these manufacturing curtailments spill into {DATE},2,27,1,0.0,0.0,0.037037037037037035,0.0,0.1111111111111111,2.217722129,43.85,19434.83904,8,1.375026712,1.2170299999999998,2009-Feb-05,DUK
Just kind of taking a queue from the earlier line of questioning I think the {CARDINAL} broadest questions in my mind is just getting comfortable with the quality of the existing assets and just being comfortable with the long term growth potential has not long been impaired You guys talked a little bit about the Spraberry {PERCENT} IRR A quick question on that front If you burden us with a corporate G&A and interest what does that translate that into in terms of returns from an aggregate standpoint,5,88,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056818181818181816,2.217722129,43.85,19434.83904,8,1.375026712,1.2170299999999998,2009-Feb-05,DUK
This is Scott Levine JPMorgan I 'm guessing that 's me With regard to the acquisitions obviously a pickup in activity Were any of the deals notably larger than any of the others or were they all kind of roughly same size approximately give or take And can you remind us maybe or update us with regard to your thoughts on what the acquisition pipeline activity might look like into a slowing economy {DATE},4,74,1,0.0,0.02702702702702703,0.05405405405405406,0.0,0.013513513513513514,7.027322322000001,43.85,3075.68455,11,1.053516403,2.40307,2009-Feb-05,AIZ
That 's helpful And just {CARDINAL} last question if I could For your upfront strategy I would think {CARDINAL} thing you 're fighting for {DATE} here is to try to get the highest price increases as possible to get a fair shake for your inventory Is this you said you 're well positioned for the upfront Is the kind of upfront where you continue to fight for price or do you have to consider relative market shares because of the potential weakness in the overall marketplace Do you hold back on inventory to get price,7,95,1,0.010526315789473684,0.021052631578947368,0.021052631578947368,0.010526315789473684,0.021052631578947368,7.209545775,43.85,3861.76896,11,0.624238002,0.19315,2009-Feb-05,AVB
Okay And then is there any negative impact from a lack of clearance inventory I know that there certainly are times of {DATE} when that does drive traffic Is {DATE} of them or is that really more of a {DATE} driver,4,41,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04878048780487805,4.736477329,43.85,3567.24,11,0.888022525,0.02226,2009-Feb-05,CINF
Then just {CARDINAL} last question On the mortgage business have you looked to cut costs Have cost cutting plans been put in place Or is there an opportunity in {DATE} to bring down some of your mortgage related expenses,4,39,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02564102564102564,0.05128205128205128,3.1548165210000003,43.85,13525.00732,9,0.452125601,1.54149,2009-Feb-05,CAH
Just going back to the guidance as far as the interest expense line and just trying to get a better handle on capitalized interest have you guys at all adjusted the pace of development Have you either sped it up or perhaps slowed it down since you raised the capital,2,50,1,0.0,0.02,0.02,0.02,0.02,3.1548165210000003,43.85,13525.00732,9,0.452125601,1.54149,2009-Feb-05,CAH
Okay But just to finish that one was the mix intra category mix so i.e. trade down Or inter category mix i.e. you sold more of the lower price per unit stuff,3,32,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.974775578,43.73,5780.86704,12,1.023415907,3.6979,2009-Feb-06,WY
So how far along in that process are you and how much additional pricing pressure if any would you expect to see from that transition,1,25,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.974775578,43.73,5780.86704,12,1.023415907,3.6979,2009-Feb-06,WY
I guess Ted if I was just to read your script and maybe this is the hard part about putting out your script but toward the end when you talk about the financially disciplined not invest new funds into EMG unless we can see a clear and compelling path Can you help us understand what a clear and compelling path would be relative to not putting capital into the businesses you guys have avoided that for so long,2,78,1,0.0,0.01282051282051282,0.01282051282051282,0.0,0.0,4.743515037,43.73,3543.6240000000007,3,0.584323113,4.55439,2009-Feb-06,ROP
Just in terms of your acceleration in your comp to {PERCENT} from {PERCENT} {DATE} So a nice acceleration Where did you see the biggest acceleration Was it commercial Was it DIY Was it the acquired stores Was it the core stores,7,41,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,15.24874476,43.73,4535.61639,11,1.877821197,15.87094,2009-Feb-06,HIG
Moving to PSM obviously a strong result out of Label and Packaging Materials but can you talk a little bit more about which end markets were strong Was it more in the packaged goods end markets or was it more in variable information end markets Can you parse that out a little bit for us,3,55,1,0.0,0.0,0.01818181818181818,0.03636363636363636,0.0,3.367761678,43.73,15837.63984,10,0.449104571,0.11459,2009-Feb-06,BIIB
Okay but for the time being it is not really affecting how you are looking at the business itself and again you focus on,1,24,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.367761678,43.73,15837.63984,10,0.449104571,0.11459,2009-Feb-06,BIIB
Good {TIME} In PSM you have a major competitor that 's recently discussed plans to reduce Label stock capacity in Europe and a few other lower growth markets And I 'm just wondering when you look at your footprint following your restructuring efforts are you comfortable with it Are there regions where you might have further opportunities to rationalize capacity Or generally how do you think about the right footprint to get you to your long term growth and margin targets in the segment,5,84,1,0.0,0.011904761904761904,0.011904761904761904,0.023809523809523808,0.023809523809523808,5.442500684,43.37,2674.77417,2,0.988583732,0.95106,2009-Feb-09,WHR
John I think you mentioned that there were {CARDINAL} working tracks on the integration process in the merger Is there anything at this point you can comment on in terms of your initial forecast of {MONEY} of synergies and {MONEY} of spend to get there Any color on that at this point,3,52,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.442500684,43.37,2674.77417,2,0.988583732,0.95106,2009-Feb-09,WHR
And the spike in commodity turkey prices that happened recently is that a net positive for you in {DATE} or is it neutral,1,23,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043478260869565216,0.0,4.449240438,43.37,5293.575,10,0.051987638,0.35712,2009-Feb-09,VRTX
It is n't just about price though Does n't it just require you to lower your prices or shift your mix in order to compete,2,25,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.449240438,43.37,5293.575,10,0.051987638,0.35712,2009-Feb-09,VRTX
Okay And then I 'm going to switch for moment Tom I know you 've been talking about a large {MONEY} order for some time and it 's always hard to pin down a date Could you elaborate a little bit on what gives you increased confidence that we 'll see it in {DATE},4,54,1,0.018518518518518517,0.018518518518518517,0.018518518518518517,0.0,0.0,4.804700957,43.64,13558.6356,3,0.442734393,1.16125,2009-Feb-10,AMAT
{DATE} David A couple quick questions First in the I&I segment that segment has started obviously to stabilize post the mining cycle Do think margins of {PERCENT} {DATE} is that new norm or does that include some of the benefits of project closeouts from the mining cycle,4,47,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02127659574468085,0.0425531914893617,10.34419702,43.64,4416.5602,11,0.346114355,0.34532,2009-Feb-10,PFG
Good Just within the Technology Solutions segment just wondering maybe if you could give us a little bit more color just in terms of how to think about this trajectory revenue going forward Maybe within Corporate Solutions like how long is the sales cycle for the next generation IR platform and with a market technology the order backlog looks good a big chunk of that is Borsa Istanbul I 'm just wonder when exactly it will be coming online,5,79,1,0.0,0.0379746835443038,0.0379746835443038,0.02531645569620253,0.0,5.450322476,43.64,5429.09634,12,0.582824572,3.2172,2009-Feb-10,VMC
Okay Along those lines the comment about you are attracting larger personal lines accounts is that just is that high net worth customers or is that bundling or a combination,2,30,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.450322476,43.64,5429.09634,12,0.582824572,3.2172,2009-Feb-10,VMC
Got it That 's helpful And then I kind of wanted to follow on David Heikkinen 's question too I guess maybe in reverse he was talking about maybe looking at ways to save on well costs Would you cut back on your well costs there or cut back on what you 're putting into your wells I 'm wondering have you found the limits yet on where you think you 've optimized the sand concentrations in particular with these wells,7,81,1,0.0,0.024691358024691357,0.024691358024691357,0.0,0.037037037037037035,4.08532289,43.64,6282.03732,1,0.592603686,1.96673,2009-Feb-10,VFC
Okay all right And then just a final question on the performance and enthusiast graphics with the new product line on {CARDINAL} nm do you feel that you can continue to gain market share here in {DATE} and what is the outlook for that segment of the market given consumer spending patterns,2,52,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.019230769230769232,0.019230769230769232,4.08532289,43.64,6282.03732,1,0.592603686,1.96673,2009-Feb-10,VFC
Thanks Hello It was great going down in Golden again and seeing the facility It 's amazing how efficient that plant is even though it dates back to the 's I was wondering directionally can you comment is there further room to improve within North America on things like skeleton metal usage and line speeds In other words how do you keep improving returns within an existing base of investment that has been around for {DATE} How would you size that for us right now,7,85,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047058823529411764,0.0,3.759937884,43.64,830.1924,11,0.591615552,2.04466,2009-Feb-10,CNC
Couple quick questions one you have mentioned a few times about the weakness in the sheet market Can you just expand Is that really a function of oversupply and the import situation or is it demand sort of flattening out here,4,41,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07317073170731707,3.759937884,43.64,830.1924,11,0.591615552,2.04466,2009-Feb-10,CNC
Sure {CARDINAL} things I guess {CARDINAL} just the one of the comments you see in a lot of reviews is the issue about corporate e mail Are there thoughts about relative of the phone about trying to address that market Have you had any discussions with some of the major providers of corporate e mail along those lines or have you thought about how you 're going to try to address that corporate market The second was just again to clarify in terms of the accounting treatment Just relative to what you 're going to recognize in the deferred revenues going forward can you clarify for us what you 're going to put in there,6,115,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.759937884,43.64,830.1924,11,0.591615552,2.04466,2009-Feb-10,CNC
GM strike was there any impact and do you foresee any impact,1,12,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.955019523,46.67,4935.69377,6,0.205615622,0.09796,2009-Feb-11,NTAP
And given that they 're running these cars for longer and they may not be selling you as many cars right now when they do go to the market in volume which I 'm guessing is at {DATE} is this going to have any major impact on you guys at all,1,51,1,0.0,0.0196078431372549,0.0196078431372549,0.0,0.0,4.955019523,46.67,4935.69377,6,0.205615622,0.09796,2009-Feb-11,NTAP
And I guess the bigger question on the margin also is just as far as understanding so that should carry then into {DATE} as a positive because if I 'm assuming that you are going to be continuously reinvesting and seeing the benefits of moving a lot amounts of low spread names and rolloff into higher yielding should we presume also that that should carry into {DATE} as a trend,1,70,1,0.0,0.0,0.02857142857142857,0.014285714285714285,0.014285714285714285,2.06952078,44.53,6453.0,10,0.317283484,0.677,2009-Feb-12,LH
Gentlemen good {TIME} and thank you for taking my questions here Turning back to Monument Butte proper can you discuss current day economics really the net backs in the play {DATE} versus what you are realizing in the Williston Basin recognizing of course that we are talking {CARDINAL} different liquids,2,50,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02,0.02,5.218481295,44.53,3311.5145,3,0.29713616800000003,2.55752,2009-Feb-12,MLM
In terms of volume growth these are very nice results in that Pressure Sensitive Materials business Do those seem sustainable to you given that there may be some I know it is hard to quantify whether there is seasonality in {DATE} but normally it seems that {DATE} always do a little better than the first and the fourth So are the current volume rates that we see sustainable going to {DATE},3,71,1,0.014084507042253521,0.014084507042253521,0.028169014084507043,0.014084507042253521,0.0,5.911109605,44.53,2187.38644,2,0.833196959,1.2707700000000002,2009-Feb-12,BWA
Thanks Hi guys So first question on retail re engagement You guys are posting really great trading numbers along with everybody else I guess what I 'm trying to figure out if we look at your activity rates {DATE} and compare them maybe back to pre recession peaks it seems like you and others are kind of already back up to that level So I guess what I am wondering do you think this cycle we could see higher highs in activity levels given you have other things going on like growth in mobile trading or growth in derivatives or do you think that we are kind of getting to the upper band of how much higher activity levels can go,7,121,1,0.0,0.01652892561983471,0.024793388429752067,0.008264462809917356,0.01652892561983471,5.911109605,44.53,2187.38644,2,0.833196959,1.2707700000000002,2009-Feb-12,BWA
Thank you And I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more detail on how Washington performed in {DATE} and particularly the trends you 're seeing in {DATE} by submarkets,2,32,1,0.0,0.03125,0.03125,0.0,0.0,4.91829473,44.53,14865.864,11,0.629502751,1.15061,2009-Feb-12,AET
Okay How do you measure intrinsic value,2,7,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.91829473,44.53,14865.864,11,0.629502751,1.15061,2009-Feb-12,AET
I just wanted to follow up without asking any specific points about your CCAR submission Can you help us think through your stance on capital return over this CCAR cycle given obviously what 's going on with your acquisition activity,2,40,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.91829473,44.53,14865.864,11,0.629502751,1.15061,2009-Feb-12,AET
If we do see a sales breakout in {DATE} it sounds like it will more than likely originate on the Commercial side of the business that 's where you had the greatest opportunities Is that accurate,2,36,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05555555555555555,0.0,3.563558544,44.53,3004.798,10,0.084076733,3.36679,2009-Feb-12,ALXN
Yeah that 's helpful And Greg while I have got you so obviously you have got {MONEY} from the FAS {CARDINAL} and then {MONEY} of run rate from the lease contributions that have n't picked up yet And I realize you are not going to give {DATE} until {DATE} but you buys have typically targeted a {PERCENT} growth in earnings and I guess the question is what will be the base that you are going to use Are you going to exclude say the {CARDINAL} Park promote or are you going to grow up the {CARDINAL},4,96,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.010416666666666666,3.563558544,44.53,3004.798,10,0.084076733,3.36679,2009-Feb-12,ALXN
Hi guys good {TIME} Wondering if you can give us any sense at all at what percent of Protiviti 's revenue at this point remains in the SOX realm,2,29,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.034482758620689655,0.0,3.563558544,44.53,3004.798,10,0.084076733,3.36679,2009-Feb-12,ALXN
Okay Then just I was a little bit surprised that the Pratt restructuring was n't a little bit higher given that is where a lot of the pressure is going to be felt in {CARDINAL} I presume Can you just maybe comment on that,3,44,1,0.0,0.022727272727272728,0.045454545454545456,0.0,0.022727272727272728,3.5297621610000003,44.53,8087.5895,5,0.198247907,0.56702,2009-Feb-12,ECL
The interest expense for {DATE} was {MONEY} Is that a good number to use for {DATE},2,16,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0625,0.0,3.5297621610000003,44.53,8087.5895,5,0.198247907,0.56702,2009-Feb-12,ECL
Okay But given your sense I 'm guessing you 've known when we were {DATE} in the hole before is this multiple quarters How do we think about the time to catch up on something like that,3,37,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8.475124956,44.53,3748.54488,11,0.500186004,7.505560000000001,2009-Feb-12,VTR

And recently even though the consumer remains weak and unemployment 's a big problem you have n't seen any incremental pressure from a pricing perspective,1,25,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12,2.4169300330000003,44.53,4021.70855,8,0.989573415,0.27872,2009-Feb-12,SCG
Okay thanks And then with regard to acquisitions in {DATE} this was asked earlier may primarily on MedServe so I assume it rings true across each of the acquisitions as a whole since that 's the big piece when it was entered more SQ than LQ but just kind of for those who those of us who model the acquisition is that a {CARDINAL} Any further color And not specific asking on MedServe but all the {TIME},5,77,1,0.0,0.012987012987012988,0.025974025974025976,0.0,0.0,4.947150522,41.25,6055.0692,6,0.374532407,0.25,2009-Feb-13,CTSH
Chris are you talking more about the SAP specific benefits and the fallout from that or is there another component just on the core blocking and tackling separate from that,1,30,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03333333333333333,4.947150522,41.25,6055.0692,6,0.374532407,0.25,2009-Feb-13,CTSH
Thank you Jon a quick question on the segment for {DATE} you gave Just want to make sure that I got it right You said that the communication flat industrial that {CARDINAL} flat and data processing down and consumer up and if that is correct if I enter that number I guess data processing will be down something like {PERCENT} Is that accurate and if that is is there a program ending what 's going on in that segment,5,79,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.012658227848101266,4.947150522,41.25,6055.0692,6,0.374532407,0.25,2009-Feb-13,CTSH
So I mean but in the guidance if you do have that inventory reduction and your facilities are running at a lower rate would n't that impact margins as well,1,30,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.65786732,42.93,5285.3034,9,0.385045536,0.54006,2009-Feb-17,GPC
Hi thanks for fitting me in This {CARDINAL} pertains to some of the additional businesses that you 've taken on from SST I think you made a comment in your prepared remarks that you would greatly improve the gross margin of the business I just want to make sure that I understand correctly On {MONEY} of revenue from SST it looks like the gross margin of that additional business was {MONEY} or {PERCENT} gross margin If I assume that you did attain your {PERCENT} gross margin on your core business is that correct,6,93,1,0.0,0.0,0.010752688172043012,0.03225806451612903,0.0,2.65786732,42.93,5285.3034,9,0.385045536,0.54006,2009-Feb-17,GPC
Okay And given that answer would it be fair to assume then that you 're driving the comp more selling to existing customers Or are you actually attracting a greater percentage of the sales being due to new customers coming through the online channel,3,44,1,0.0,0.0,0.022727272727272728,0.022727272727272728,0.0,2.65786732,42.93,5285.3034,9,0.385045536,0.54006,2009-Feb-17,GPC
And final question looking at your remainder of PPAs with other IPPs are you seeing more opportunity {DATE} to do that Calpine type acquisition of assets or are the conditions or the PPA terms not ripe {DATE} to replicate something like that,1,42,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.023809523809523808,0.023809523809523808,5.013859984,48.66,1971.88096,4,1.277763675,1.0858,2009-Feb-18,XEC
Scott a couple questions for you on upgrades Then Steve maybe a couple of accounting clarifiers if I could Scott just on upgrades a good number of {CARDINAL} systems out there and obviously a number of {CARDINAL} hybrid units that you 're selling at this point Any sense if over {DATE} you 'd expect to see any upgrade programs going taking those to {CARDINAL} systems,4,65,1,0.0,0.03076923076923077,0.03076923076923077,0.015384615384615385,0.015384615384615385,3.5461143180000003,48.46,3740.15646,9,0.550642775,4.06094,2009-Feb-19,ORLY

Okay That 's great Thanks Then just secondly you brought down the expense midpoint on the core basis down {MONEY} Looks like you 're accelerating forward some of those expense saves I 'm just wondering what areas you 're seeing those opportunities to trim out some costs,6,47,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0425531914893617,0.0,5.605065805,48.46,8014.6349,8,1.413475693,0.82158,2009-Feb-19,WMB
I remember {DATE} capacity utilization was the most important thing to follow Has your business philosophy changed since then it 's more revenue management,2,24,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.296600700000001,48.46,20228.13112,12,0.451270851,0.20592,2009-Feb-19,NEM
So sounds like dividends and debt paydown is going to be the primary use of cash outside of serendipitous acquisitions,1,20,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.404176782,48.46,4092.28092,1,0.5280911389999999,2.5869,2009-Feb-19,HRL
Okay And then in terms of the outlook it would seem to me that {DATE} within {PERCENT} should see higher growth than {DATE} I mean obviously that depends on how the macro plays out through {DATE} but given the comparables Is that the right way to think about it,4,49,1,0.0,0.02040816326530612,0.02040816326530612,0.0,0.0,2.404176782,48.46,4092.28092,1,0.5280911389999999,2.5869,2009-Feb-19,HRL

Okay thanks And then just one on M&A. I do n't know if I am reading too much into something but you seem to you had an additional line in the release about looking at flooring opportunities spent some time in the prepared remarks looking at M&A. Has anything changed there Are you closer to any other deals or is that just sort of the standard view that you look to continually do deals in the space,6,77,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.012987012987012988,0.0,6.2579161989999985,49.3,2560.95143,9,0.442667919,0.45057,2009-Feb-23,JWN
Okay And then last question to me With Cushing inventories having been depleted more recently and another drawdown {DATE} does that have any impact on Ponca and Borger Or do you do all your inventory inside the refining fence or do you look at the Cushing market the Cushing storage tanks also to balance that,4,55,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03636363636363636,6.077810474,52.62,3127.2696,12,0.700727478,3.85325,2009-Feb-24,PWR
A question for you on EagleView I wanted to check and see if the Company was still on the same trajectory as what we had talked about earlier in the year when it had first been announced and we have been looking for revenue of {MONEY} in {DATE} EBITDA {MONEY} and then growing at let 's say {PERCENT} to to {MONEY} in revenue with {MONEY} in cost synergies getting to {MONEY} in EBITDA I wanted to see if the Company was still on that trajectory,3,85,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.011764705882352941,6.077810474,52.62,3127.2696,12,0.700727478,3.85325,2009-Feb-24,PWR
Okay okay Got it Then you would expect by hopefully we 're at a more normalized operational rate there,3,19,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.224190929,52.62,9545.46258,8,0.8649459829999999,2.82682,2009-Feb-24,SRE
And then just lastly Kelly you talked a lot about the pricing pressure on loans As we do see rates starting to move up slowly can you envision with all the liquidity which is driving like you are saying be chasing of assets maybe being the opposite and allowing a little bit more room once you do get some relief with rates moving even modestly higher to be able to re create some deposit spreads,2,75,1,0.0,0.013333333333333334,0.013333333333333334,0.013333333333333334,0.013333333333333334,4.479434475,52.62,21401.5354,9,0.603246013,1.2252299999999998,2009-Feb-24,TGT
If I could sneak {CARDINAL} in if you capture that kind of growth do you think you will get a pricing boost as well,1,24,1,0.0,0.041666666666666664,0.041666666666666664,0.041666666666666664,0.0,4.479434475,52.62,21401.5354,9,0.603246013,1.2252299999999998,2009-Feb-24,TGT

Thanks for taking my questions Steve on the corporate initial services business management has always been consistent that being bigger is not necessarily better Given the disruption in the overall operating environment questions about capital adequacy weighing on competitors how aggressive are you being with winning new business there and are you pleased with the pace of the market share gains so far on the C&IS side of the business,3,70,1,0.014285714285714285,0.0,0.0,0.05714285714285714,0.04285714285714286,3.095417308,45.49,2404.59104,8,1.1197498890000002,3.41713,2009-Feb-25,CMS
Then you were talking about the new fuel efficiency standards that are going to be coming out and I guess Kenworth was talking about that 's likely the end of the long and tall trucks and I am just wondering conceptually how much of an impact is that going to have on the business as we transition to these more aerodynamic fuel efficient trucks from PACCAR 's perspective how meaningful to the business is that {DATE} how meaningful to the margin profile of the company in North America,2,88,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.022727272727272728,0.0,2.334453472,45.49,4088.63268,8,1.069501571,0.33289,2009-Feb-25,CNP

Okay Because my question relates to it is a delicate topic but Management 's succession And maybe this is more appropriately directed to M 's Board but I 'm surprised there has not been more clarity about succession plans at And if you compare the big industrials UTX GE always have these well signaled transitions and it has been really frankly ambiguous at So does the Board not consider this to be a priority What comments can you share with us {TIME},6,82,1,0.012195121951219513,0.012195121951219513,0.024390243902439025,0.0,0.012195121951219513,3.05673992,44.66,8251.3704,12,0.7760192220000001,0.64399,2009-Feb-27,RSG
Okay Yes To my recollection mid single digit negative price in hips and knees in the US is at the high end of historical levels Has there been a secular change and what might be driving that Is it reversible,5,40,1,0.0,0.025,0.025,0.0,0.025,6.22973141,44.66,1696.4824,12,1.033520263,3.09521,2009-Feb-27,IPG
Okay As a second question are you completely agnostic to diesel prices due to pass throughs Or is there perhaps any small portion that 's not passed through or kind of lower floor limits on surcharges where if Brent continued to go lower you would perhaps break through the floor and capture margin Anything along those lines,4,57,1,0.0,0.03508771929824561,0.03508771929824561,0.0,0.03508771929824561,2.651917789,46.35,8868.575420000001,8,1.466118272,0.38855,2009-Mar-02,EIX

I was wondering if you would be able to give us a comment on the outlook in {DATE} for Acrobat revenues and again qualitatively should we expect those revenues to be up sequentially or down sequentially,1,36,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.027777777777777776,0.0,2.651917789,46.35,8868.575420000001,8,1.466118272,0.38855,2009-Mar-02,EIX

In another one of your comments you talked about at least in the sales process and the sales market that the agencies are having a hard time keeping up Can you sort of expand on that a little bit There 's not having enough resources or is their process taking longer in terms of underwriting,3,55,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.9325628010000004,52.65,8046.82395,9,0.028079075,3.41362,2009-Mar-03,AZO
Very quickly on the back on the Carthage to Perryville phase {CARDINAL} now with good strong nonbinding support is there a timeframe where you think that that might actually go down into a binding open season I understand there 's a lot of negotiations now and a lot of competition but is that something that we might be able to see by {DATE} at least as far as entering into a binding open {DATE} How should we think about that on timing,3,82,1,0.0,0.024390243902439025,0.024390243902439025,0.036585365853658534,0.0,2.394354938,49.68,12696.75484,9,0.38075672,1.03734,2009-Mar-10,KR
Great Good {TIME} First just on that comment that you made around guidance in the philosophy and the DNA of Stryker I 'm just curious could n't you have higher goals internally than the guidance that you give to Wall Street,3,41,1,0.0,0.024390243902439025,0.024390243902439025,0.04878048780487805,0.0,3.942584168,43.74,9669.55275,6,0.371586543,1.61532,2009-Mar-17,ADBE
And then in terms of PDI when you guys gave your pre announcement were you talking about gases volume being down {PERCENT} and hard goods down {PERCENT} for {DATE} It looks like adding in some pricing you still came in quite a bit better than those expectations Can you talk about what had changed in {DATE} And yet do you maybe have a slightly more optimistic outlook for {DATE} given given where you came in {DATE},4,76,1,0.0,0.013157894736842105,0.013157894736842105,0.02631578947368421,0.0,2.840397725,40.8,76744.5756,6,0.206102392,5.1665199999999984,2009-Mar-18,ORCL
And I guess on {DATE} trends Steve have RevPARs for the hotel have they improved relative to for Las Vegas And then also I 'm not sure who was speaking but earlier somebody said that you on room rate or room programs that you seem to be fine tuning that on some of the marketing programs Could you just give some examples of how that 's evolved over {DATE} because it 's been pretty quick,3,75,1,0.0,0.013333333333333334,0.013333333333333334,0.013333333333333334,0.0,3.0831025960000003,40.8,3239.148,1,0.524209138,0.47988,2009-Mar-18,CTAS

And your expectation is the type of recovery would it focus most likely on these high service intensive shale plays like the Haynesville and Marcellus,1,25,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.943321939,40.06,3475.60544,11,1.204788928,1.60934,2009-Mar-19,DFS
Great Thank you Also just a quick question with regard to your combination LCGCMS Is that an interesting opportunity for you guys kind of in items of where you might put additional investment or could you kind of comment on that talk about that business,4,45,1,0.0,0.044444444444444446,0.044444444444444446,0.044444444444444446,0.022222222222222223,3.759880013,40.06,13401.1206,12,0.553967679,2.06894,2009-Mar-19,FDX
Okay Shifting gears to Buell dealers that carry Buell will have excess working capital dollars How would you expect those dealers to allocate those dollars Do you have a product in mind that they might carry to fill that gap,4,40,1,0.0,0.025,0.025,0.0,0.0,3.806715605,42.93,2902.73538,6,0.425227337,3.09901,2009-Mar-25,RHT

And then with respect to the Sterling and your comments on the potential difficulties to your optimization business is there pressure to close the Mont Belvieu Conway gap in the sense that if you do n't do it quickly enough a competitor will do it and make your strategic and business life a little bit more challenging,1,57,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03508771929824561,3.579515432,37.81,5670.91358,9,0.223355446,0.37631,2009-Apr-14,FAST

Okay and just {CARDINAL} follow up Would it be possible in the future to combine some of the smaller equity affiliates consolidate shared services and technology So it would take the best breed products and maybe I guess sort of internal M&A What combinations could you envision on that,4,49,1,0.02040816326530612,0.061224489795918366,0.061224489795918366,0.02040816326530612,0.0,2.910497952,35.79,5937.0146,11,0.866733978,2.08054,2009-Apr-17,PBCT

Okay thanks Then my other question is just thinking about your retail business you lost a little bit of comp relative to your big competitor in Chicago and they count things differently I realize that and they 've added liquor and stuff like that But is there anything that they are doing now but maybe you wish you would have done Is there anything you are thinking about with your retail business to maybe try to get back a comp point or {CARDINAL} relative to what you were doing {DATE},7,90,1,0.0,0.022222222222222223,0.022222222222222223,0.0,0.022222222222222223,6.590457722000001,35.79,11807.81763,11,0.843591984,2.46057,2009-Apr-17,BBT

Thanks for taking the question Could you maybe just lay out the other countries that you 're looking to try and enter over {DATE} and for these countries that you 're entering now are you trying to enter with a label and a plan for both PNH and aHUS or is it still leading with PNH and then following up with aHUS over some period of time,2,67,1,0.0,0.029850746268656716,0.029850746268656716,0.014925373134328358,0.014925373134328358,13.3587057,33.94,67854.7128,11,1.972538975,3.4386300000000003,2009-Apr-20,BAC
Okay okay And then just on the and I think I can probably infer from your comment but when you were talking about Wilmington Trust and trust revenue is up {PERCENT} year over year and giving your add or whatever you said it was did that {PERCENT} that you guys posted is that better than what you expected in line with what you expected or a little bit light having gone in when you first went into the budgetary process,2,80,1,0.0,0.0,0.0125,0.0125,0.0,3.780092467,39.18,13086.90537,10,1.328094993,0.43836,2009-Apr-21,BSX

All right that 's helpful And I guess just jumping over to some of the asset sales Obviously you guys are sold the Granite Wash you are working on China paying down debt with Granite Wash. How should we think about use of proceeds for a China sale here It certainly seems as though you guys have a lot of capital coming in the door here in {DATE},5,68,1,0.0,0.0,0.014705882352941176,0.0,0.0,7.4023911999999985,39.18,4756.54665,12,0.358386558,1.35511,2009-Apr-21,DAL

So Bill do you have a view on a rate a composite rate Should we expect something around flat like it was for or like you are anticipating for {DATE} or is it too early to really think about a point estimate number,2,43,1,0.0,0.0,0.023255813953488372,0.0,0.0,2.7369427410000005,39.18,43224.34617,3,0.314594827,0.01721,2009-Apr-21,UTX

Hi good {TIME} or {TIME} to you guys Just {CARDINAL} very quick questions On Greg 's question when he was going over the quarter and how that was comparing to your plan and then using the {MONEY} as you state would it be fair to say looking at what we have for the second third and fourth quarters that you 're at this point because of the strong first quarter Again I understand it 's early in {DATE} but trending towards the high end of your guidance range,4,88,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.022727272727272728,0.022727272727272728,14.45965193,39.18,13290.85145,11,0.641659518,0.37241,2009-Apr-21,STT

All right So no change in strategy I guess the related question is really is really I wanted to revisit something you said when the Company was separated from Conoco to begin with And that was that you really had no interest in expanding or building out refining and you wanted to diversify but you are clearly going great Refining has been very strong I 'm just curious if strategically your views have changed any or if you 're still very much on the opinion of taking that as a windfall and moving into these other businesses,8,97,1,0.010309278350515464,0.0,0.0,0.020618556701030927,0.010309278350515464,6.047504255,39.18,5831.70809,11,0.981252261,2.01788,2009-Apr-21,MTB

Yes that 's clear {CARDINAL} quick question on the bigger picture where you commented that your company has n't experienced declines even during recessions but there were {CARDINAL} periods where you were down on your same store sales What were the circumstances around that if you could remind us Do you think the macroenvironment has shifted and is more challenging and it will play to your strengths and advantages Or what is your take on the macro,5,77,1,0.0,0.012987012987012988,0.012987012987012988,0.025974025974025976,0.05194805194805195,3.771902368,37.14,3343.1865,12,0.313077571,0.15707000000000002,2009-Apr-22,RHI
Looking at your capital ratios it looks like the total capital ratio is getting a little bit close to the capitalized threshold Do you have any contingency plans for if something happens between now and {DATE} you know something unforeseen of course that would drop that below the {PERCENT} limit And given that idea it looks as though you guys are fairly filled up on tier {CARDINAL} type of securities so are there other types of things you might consider issuing,3,81,1,0.0,0.012345679012345678,0.024691358024691357,0.0,0.012345679012345678,5.46869687,37.14,16767.27837,12,0.46936801,0.15477,2009-Apr-22,FCX

In terms of managing the tobacco business and trying to run the overall enterprise to maximize profitability Do you think that premium versus lowest price pricing gaps within the cigarette category exclusively have become less important,2,36,1,0.027777777777777776,0.0,0.0,0.05555555555555555,0.0,3.314726928,37.15,2650.9934,12,0.197316085,2.06904,2009-Apr-24,NFLX

Just one last question I had asked this on {DATE} conference call as well Some think that California real estate has bottomed You still see a contraction in liquidity to subprime and some subprime actually looks like it deteriorated this is for the industry {DATE} Could you comment on your outlook on subprime because you do have exposure there and as does the industry and if we 're seeing stabilization of losses there or what your outlook is,6,78,1,0.0,0.01282051282051282,0.02564102564102564,0.01282051282051282,0.05128205128205128,4.344775898,38.1,4921.88499,6,0.34855819,3.93627,2009-Apr-23,WDC

Okay Then the lease spreads the rent on expiration was much higher than you reported previously Obviously your lease terms were way up I wonder if those were sort of related and whether we might see that number as a blip that comes back down based on maybe closings of high end stores or if that 's not accurate,4,59,1,0.0,0.03389830508474576,0.03389830508474576,0.0,0.01694915254237288,3.307236554,38.1,167136.7416,6,0.144138484,0.04648,2009-Apr-23,MSFT

Thank you very much I just have {CARDINAL} questions If I look at your guidance for {DATE} how shall I think ASP units standard mix given that we had slightly lower ASP for which it seems units might have been up {PERCENT} for And looking into how should we think about that mix and at what point should we expect the mix of new products to kind of kick in and help stabilize ASP 's,4,75,1,0.0,0.013333333333333334,0.02666666666666667,0.013333333333333334,0.013333333333333334,3.49562982,36.08,1618.35954,6,0.973367614,8.90185,2009-Apr-30,PKI
Absolutely And it seems that the productivity the capacity can be great and I 'm just trying to figure out how much can you actually sell And I think maybe you 've spoken about the potential of maybe exporting the gas but is that would Israel actually allow exports of a resource like that,3,54,1,0.0,0.037037037037037035,0.05555555555555555,0.018518518518518517,0.0,7.886009887,36.08,6159.6885200000015,11,0.58866594,4.58317,2009-Apr-30,EQR
Rob in some of the key end markets where we did see some sequential improvement that are more cyclical in nature what were some of the specific sort of end customer segments that showed signs of life And what particularly on industrial side what specific customer segments are still sort of showing no order activity or your backlog is pretty bare,2,61,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01639344262295082,0.0,2.209282062,36.08,4671.2094,8,1.3841970819999998,10.49623,2009-Apr-30,DTE

Got it okay that 's helpful And on the guidance if we add back {MONEY} for the expected FX hit but if we deduct let 's just say {MONEY} or so for UBS it looks like a constant currency sequential guide of {PERCENT} Does this reflect your conservatism or is there anything in that you 're cognizant of so to speak in your guidance,3,64,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.357374275,36.08,3301.31734,11,1.053516403,6.43312,2009-Apr-30,AIZ

Is it fair to say it sounds like the rent to income profile is being maintained if not improving a bit So are you seeing is it fair to say that we are seeing more of a want to renter as opposed to a need to renter,2,47,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02127659574468085,0.02127659574468085,8.76734749,36.08,13616.061119999997,11,0.356481128,2.10764,2009-Apr-30,AFL
I 'm particularly impressed by the acceleration in Latin America in the like for like for Flavors There is a bulk ingredient company I am sure you are familiar with Ingredion that had {PERCENT} down volume in Latin America in their food ingredients And I was curious whether you overcame similar weakness in Sweet and Brewery I think they cited as their weaker markets in Latin America And so your growth was in spite of that Or because you are such a small percent of the price of the products you did n't see any effect at all in Latin America from the weakness in the end markets,7,108,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.009259259259259259,0.027777777777777776,8.76734749,36.08,13616.061119999997,11,0.356481128,2.10764,2009-Apr-30,AFL
Maybe if you can talk about how are you working with private payers on reimbursement and that front I guess the question I 'm asking is are you seeing any pushback there on their effective subsidization of the dialysis program Or is the fact that they can also see this Medicare rate update scaring them away from even trying to impact the reimbursement on the commercial side,4,67,1,0.0,0.014925373134328358,0.014925373134328358,0.014925373134328358,0.014925373134328358,2.9679777310000004,36.08,2563.8333,5,0.2451492,0.59604,2009-Apr-30,IFF
Okay Okay And then Arnold you have talked about multiple initiatives here Not only {DATE} but prior and sounds like there is more detail still coming If we back up and as you had some time now to frame everything is there any I guess guesstimate at this point as to what new normalized costs ex fuel would be on a go forward basis And I guess relative to where they were in {DATE} so pre Concordia,7,77,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.868018655,36.08,12429.95457,9,0.452125601,0.8809100000000001,2009-Apr-30,CAH
Hey could you guys if you do n't mind just give us a little bit more color on your direct and indirect segment It looks like you performed really well there in {DATE} just how we should think about that going forward especially with the indirects of sequential improvement Is that trend sustainable,3,53,1,0.0,0.018867924528301886,0.018867924528301886,0.018867924528301886,0.0,12.01780947,36.5,3732.73945,11,1.877821197,1.14289,2009-May-01,HIG
Going back I 've got {CARDINAL} question on {DATE} and {CARDINAL} question on some of the drivers I guess I 'll start with {DATE} As I look at the summary on page {CARDINAL} it looks like the I 'm sorry not the summary on page {CARDINAL} the summary on page {CARDINAL} with all the items impacting {DATE} The income tax swing the ESJ wind gain and the release of the allowance I understand that you had they 're offsetting things that happened in {DATE} like the gain you had on Copper Mountain But as we look forward into {DATE} and we look at your the guidance range you gave for us for {DATE} is that already should we assume that they contemplate such gains or losses in there,7,128,1,0.0,0.0,0.0078125,0.0234375,0.0234375,12.01780947,36.5,3732.73945,11,1.877821197,1.14289,2009-May-01,HIG
Good {TIME} guys Thanks so much First question kind of goes back to the pricing issue I understand pricing has gotten a little bit better over {DATE} kind of {DATE} The question is as you guys continue to gain regain share and your competitor continues to add significant capacity is there any risk that the competitor gets a little bit over aggressive on pricing and that constrains the kind of margin expansion we expect for {DATE} How do you think about that,6,82,1,0.0,0.0,0.012195121951219513,0.04878048780487805,0.024390243902439025,2.5499831630000003,36.5,132508.8192,4,0.6622933289999999,0.8842899999999999,2009-May-01,CVX
{CARDINAL} last question where do you want to get your lot inventory to and how long do you think that takes you given what you all see in the environment right now,1,32,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03125,3.137973649,36.5,3332.45628,6,0.195042217,2.17281,2009-May-01,FLIR
And have you maybe I missed it then ex Amarillo have you talked about what the revenue run rate is from the UPL,2,23,1,0.0,0.043478260869565216,0.043478260869565216,0.0,0.043478260869565216,3.189597683,35.3,10386.44776,9,0.652180323,2.1066700000000003,2009-May-04,MCK

Just a question on cash flow because obviously at {MONEY} it was quite strong in {DATE} Can you Cathie provide us with any sort of puts and takes things to keep in mind as we look for {DATE} since obviously you did as much cash in {DATE} as you did in I think it 's all of {DATE},3,58,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.017241379310344827,0.017241379310344827,2.513136837,35.3,14347.48265,9,0.238774797,0.15525999999999998,2009-May-04,SYY
Right And that 's what I was trying to figure out When you look at the T Cheks are you getting a rise in the provision for doubtful accounts there Is there any read that you guys can take from that or from the rest of your business that gives you a sense of how fast or how much capacity is coming out right now,4,65,1,0.0,0.0,0.015384615384615385,0.0,0.015384615384615385,2.513136837,35.3,14347.48265,9,0.238774797,0.15525999999999998,2009-May-04,SYY
Does this have anything to do with maybe the mix of a lot less intermodal and somehow that coal business is more fuel efficient on a GTM basis,1,28,1,0.0,0.03571428571428571,0.03571428571428571,0.03571428571428571,0.0,4.276398509,35.3,3870.69063,10,1.1235073999999998,2.4948,2009-May-04,HOLX
And with regards to your outlook for just I think elevated level of charge offs and provisionings as you look at the {CARDINAL} lending categories that you break out in the presentation {DATE} is there any {CARDINAL} or {CARDINAL} categories that is really driving that statement or is it really a combination of all of them showing further deterioration,1,59,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03389830508474576,10.56454822,34.53,4401.6984200000015,11,0.346114355,0.58913,2009-May-05,PFG
And is there anything else I know most of your lending is related to securities activities but is there anything else in the credit portfolio that we should look for or that concerns you going forward,1,36,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.027777777777777776,10.56454822,34.53,4401.6984200000015,11,0.346114355,0.58913,2009-May-05,PFG
So I guess what I was getting at though is what 's the pool of the noncore that remains,1,19,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.322287537,34.53,2818.81441,8,1.495989519,2.25826,2009-May-05,PNW

Okay And on the Diagnostic segment just to follow up on a question that was asked earlier in a different way maybe if we look at things sequentially your Diagnostic segment increased by {MONEY} And it is pretty strong seasonality usually between {DATE} and {DATE} So I am wondering with the growth you outlined and some of the ramping up you 're outlining in HPV how we think about sequentially what happened in {DATE} and why it may not have been even stronger,3,83,1,0.0,0.024096385542168676,0.024096385542168676,0.024096385542168676,0.012048192771084338,2.322287537,34.53,2818.81441,8,1.495989519,2.25826,2009-May-05,PNW
Okay What level capacity do you think I just kind of want to understand I know you have the Heartland and the Crescent Quarter programs going on but how much capacity do you have on your network before you start need to increasing some of the capacity they so what 's left in storage,6,54,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.749613405,34.53,5252.49825,6,0.012459903,16.69265,2009-May-05,PBI

Yes thanks guys Just another question on China you talked David about sort of mid single digit expectation on the back {DATE} Just if you could give us any color on how things progressed through {DATE} if you 're starting to see some signs of stabilization that gives you comfort with that number or are you still seeing consumers tighten the belts and it 's unclear when things will stop deteriorating there,4,72,1,0.0,0.013888888888888888,0.027777777777777776,0.027777777777777776,0.027777777777777776,7.726524334,34.53,5268.36984,12,0.33736090700000004,2.7261,2009-May-05,WYNN

Okay Then maybe just a follow up for Jay I think you said the cash tax rates going from to {PERCENT} from {PERCENT} What would be driving that That is a little bit higher than normal right,5,37,1,0.0,0.02702702702702703,0.02702702702702703,0.0,0.0,4.4049433360000005,34.53,7610.34162,12,1.023415907,0.9658,2009-May-05,WY
Got you John just a very quick detail question The {PERCENT} SG&A as a percent of sales did that already include some increase in due diligence costs around M&A Did you already see an uptick in,4,36,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.027777777777777776,2.32072036,34.53,11829.00108,8,0.8649459829999999,4.41926,2009-May-05,SRE
Yes Okay But that 's no so that means that that probably need capital investment in order for you to do substantially more,4,23,1,0.0,0.0,0.043478260869565216,0.0,0.0,2.9350931730000003,34.53,1774.9850199999996,3,0.48423064,3.16231,2009-May-05,TDG

Okay Just looking obviously at with the numbers you 're spud and wells not completed and completed not online It is obviously it looks like a pretty good peak right now and obviously you guys remain pretty active Is there any midstream projects that are really key for you guys here in {DATE} just to reference,4,56,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.017857142857142856,0.0,2.9350931730000003,34.53,1774.9850199999996,3,0.48423064,3.16231,2009-May-05,TDG
Lastly any additional color as you think about the long term guidance of {PERCENT} with regards to the CapEx and CapEx specifics other than your leverage ratios will fall,1,29,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.224762979,34.53,7565.908,6,0.374532407,1.20269,2009-May-05,CTSH
As we think about that cost dynamic going forward I know you said there 's a lot of labor leverage going forward but are there any other kind of headwinds or tailwinds we should be mindful of as we model going forward,1,42,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.999539022,34.53,18262.32664,8,1.375026712,1.56252,2009-May-05,DUK
Just secondly the gross margins continue to be great and you 've shown a lot of improvement there {CARDINAL} of the competitors {TIME} mention that they 've maybe taken some actions to improve sales pace in the market which might suggest a modest negative impact on gross margins Is this something you think might continue going forward and spread through the industry or have you seen this from a competitive standpoint by other builders or in certain other markets,3,79,1,0.0,0.05063291139240506,0.05063291139240506,0.0379746835443038,0.012658227848101266,1.999539022,34.53,18262.32664,8,1.375026712,1.56252,2009-May-05,DUK

Good {TIME} I want to talk a little bit about intermodal and obviously your international customer line of companies are also feeling the high effect of fuel prices on the cost side Do you get the feeling that it is getting tougher and tougher to renegotiate these contracts given there is more push from them,3,55,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01818181818181818,0.01818181818181818,3.153533193,33.36,10637.16462,11,0.458448193,1.0259,2009-May-06,MMC
Great And then just last thing a little bit more noise about what Russia 's WTO accession might mean Can you just give a view on what you think that might mean for exports of Pork and Chicken in particular,3,40,1,0.0,0.05,0.05,0.025,0.0,5.3790065060000005,33.36,2943.58336,4,2.730011741,1.18834,2009-May-06,PXD
Just lastly for me in terms of balance sheet deployment I think you 've got total cash and securities now {MONEY} plus getting closer to that {MONEY} level that I think you guys have talked about in the past Anything we should be aware of in that regard Does share buyback seem appealing here or what 's the M&A pipeline like,3,61,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.3790065060000005,33.36,2943.58336,4,2.730011741,1.18834,2009-May-06,PXD

Thanks guys So we could talk about services for a second strong performance in {DATE} If I look back at your historicals {DATE} that you had product revenue decline you had a very strong services growth in {DATE} they really lagged your growth in product revenue Should that dynamic play itself out {DATE} if not why not,5,57,1,0.0,0.017543859649122806,0.017543859649122806,0.03508771929824561,0.03508771929824561,10.68636293,32.45,15021.211,11,1.052779128,0.6446,2009-May-07,PRU
Okay Needs to diversify more into kind of science based endeavors such as neurovascular where it 's more a PMA process but maybe higher risk but higher reward,2,28,1,0.0,0.03571428571428571,0.07142857142857142,0.03571428571428571,0.0,10.68636293,32.45,15021.211,11,1.052779128,0.6446,2009-May-07,PRU
Let me switch gears just a little bit and get your appreciation having been there just {DATE} of the Company 's financials and accounting systems How do you feel about the relative health of those systems post the acquisition from {DATE} and your visibility into the different businesses at this point,2,51,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.295609567,32.45,4367.96447,11,0.984862344,0.49457,2009-May-07,NDAQ
Okay So that 's the trailing And I guess you expect that just to continue as long as the situation continues with the curve,3,24,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.874325622,32.45,10599.58035,4,0.846173519,1.6452099999999998,2009-May-07,MUR
Wondering on the fuel line if you could talk about your hedges between WTI and the actual price of jet fuel How much of your refining margin is hedged and sort of at what level should we assume versus {PERCENT} you 're hedged on WTI,2,45,1,0.0,0.022222222222222223,0.044444444444444446,0.0,0.0,3.0830279560000005,32.45,3258.70097,6,0.301807583,2.8906400000000003,2009-May-07,TDC
Okay But do you think there will be a fuel efficiency gain in terms of the SCR versus enhanced EGR,2,20,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15,0.0,3.170737813,32.45,4174.8561,6,0.013898405,6.95395,2009-May-07,VRSN
So do you think pricing gains at those levels are sustainable then Can you continue to get those for {DATE} or,2,21,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047619047619047616,0.0,3.170737813,32.45,4174.8561,6,0.013898405,6.95395,2009-May-07,VRSN
Great Thanks I just have an accounting question If we want to back out the {MONEY} gain for the sale of the DVD business what would the offsetting tax impact be for that,4,33,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06060606060606061,0.030303030303030304,3.226304846,33.44,3789.40032,7,0.354178048,0.5,2009-May-08,SNI
New business sales growth in the previous conference calls you had mentioned that you planned to grow {PERCENT} or so {DATE} But looks like in {DATE} due to tough market conditions tough credit markets and tough new business starts it was just {PERCENT} from the numbers it looks like Now as you said earlier that probably the markets may not improve in {DATE} You are not seeing any kind of improvement Now is that a reasonable assumption that going into the fiscal {CARDINAL} looks like the credit markets are not going to improve quickly That new business sales growth might remain in {PERCENT} range for {DATE},6,106,1,0.0,0.018867924528301886,0.03773584905660377,0.02830188679245283,0.0,3.226304846,33.44,3789.40032,7,0.354178048,0.5,2009-May-08,SNI
Couple of questions One can you talk about your assumptions for currency in {DATE} and as you look out to {DATE} and I 'm making a bold assumption that I do n't think you are going to have much currency {DATE} Your share repurchases so far have been additive Do you intend to buy back enough shares to make up for the currency What 's going to be the additive parts to the earnings Or how do you handle that,6,80,1,0.0,0.0,0.025,0.0,0.0125,4.44899963,32.87,7845.596490000001,12,0.327884243,4.38791,2009-May-12,FLR
Just following up on that in {DATE} was there any effect from increasing the amount of loans that you securitized on provisioning or is that sort of a longer term effect,1,31,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.44899963,32.87,7845.596490000001,12,0.327884243,4.38791,2009-May-12,FLR
Good {TIME} Following on from that scene earlier from share buybacks I 'm guessing you probably spend {MONEY} buying back stock in {DATE} Is that a good run rate to think about on a {DATE} or on a {DATE} basis going forward assuming that margins stay where they are currently,3,50,1,0.0,0.0,0.04,0.04,0.0,4.44899963,32.87,7845.596490000001,12,0.327884243,4.38791,2009-May-12,FLR
And what are you seeing from tenants in terms of them pulling back or trying to shrink their space where maybe their inventory levels have come down and they want to be in smaller stores How are you able to accommodate for that,2,43,1,0.0,0.023255813953488372,0.023255813953488372,0.023255813953488372,0.0,4.44899963,32.87,7845.596490000001,12,0.327884243,4.38791,2009-May-12,FLR
And on Carrier pricing are you seeing any weakness there,1,10,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1,4.44899963,32.87,7845.596490000001,12,0.327884243,4.38791,2009-May-12,FLR
Got it Okay Thanks Just a question on JBoss Are you seeing with the wins that you 're seeing {DATE} sounds like an improvement Would you classify that more as pilot and departmental type wins where there 's room for growth going forward or would you say these are more some larger migrations,6,53,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.018867924528301886,0.018867924528301886,2.940310667,33.65,12782.8362,9,0.630462062,0.61102,2009-May-14,KSS
I 'm just trying to think as I play off the yen strength and the impact that will have on the ortho business Is is something different fundamentally in {DATE} than in {DATE} it has been,2,36,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.027777777777777776,0.0,5.653806246,33.65,4367.901220000002,9,0.442667919,1.94234,2009-May-14,JWN
Are you doing the same thing with {CARDINAL} bit targeting a broad spectrum or is it more focused,1,18,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.750584606,33.65,6231.8708,6,0.382025365,0.06142,2009-May-14,A
Real quickly on the services side of things with the margins you guys are putting up do you think about at some point spinning a piece of that off or monetizing a piece and putting that potential capital towards accelerating your drilling program even further,1,45,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.482757415,30.24,11546.98732,9,0.282096058,0.71649,2009-May-19,TJX
Can we make the inference that if you 're not chasing growth as much that almost means you 're going to be more shareholder friendly when it comes to cash as conditions start to get better,1,36,1,0.0,0.027777777777777776,0.027777777777777776,0.05555555555555555,0.0,3.3060066160000003,28.8,31552.97184,9,0.603246013,2.3123,2009-May-20,TGT
Okay And I mean as far as like the former CSK stores obviously you 're seeing the strongest growth in the commercial business there as well But that said is there a gross margin benefit to kind of the increasing the mix of hard parts within the business compared to what it was {DATE},3,54,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037037037037037035,0.0,3.3060066160000003,28.8,31552.97184,9,0.603246013,2.3123,2009-May-20,TGT
Okay Then we saw the total inventory number But with these with the warmer weather in {DATE} are there any pockets of inventory that you 've carried over that you were n't expecting to,3,34,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.751563923,28.8,8118.150759999998,6,0.235117887,2.78675,2009-May-20,INTU
There are a bunch of initiatives by department stores getting rolling out more department store outlets higher end department store outlet stores and flash sale websites increasing by day What do you see about what do you think about that,2,40,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.704668902,29.03,4424.49305,1,0.5280911389999999,4.98888,2009-May-21,HRL
Hi thanks Just as a follow up on Ken 's question related to spend growth outside of the acceleration we saw in GNS from new business wins do you think particularly here in the US do you think the current run rates are a good proxy for what we should see for spend over {DATE} Should we expect it to remain stable or just given the fact that we are seeing improvement from the wealth effect whether it 's higher home prices or higher markets should we start seeing that manifesting into higher spend,3,94,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.031914893617021274,0.010638297872340425,3.0372385960000003,29.03,4082.35598,9,0.338521281,3.76797,2009-May-21,AAP
Okay And then as you indicated earlier in the call your verticals perforated different formations And in your presentation you indicated you 're going to potentially try horizontals there Do you see this potentially as an exclusive horizontal program for the different formations Or do you think you 're going to mix some horizontals with some verticals for some other zones,5,61,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01639344262295082,0.0,3.187580444,30.62,14585.66026,9,0.487799094,0.31503000000000003,2009-May-27,SPLS
In regards to long term occupancy costs do you think US retailers would accept levels similar to ones seen internationally around that {PERCENT} Or are certain retailers already accepting these levels but are being washed away in the portfolio average given the constant turn and length of leases signed,2,49,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.187580444,30.62,14585.66026,9,0.487799094,0.31503000000000003,2009-May-27,SPLS
Okay And then what about and then if I could ask just a follow up on that I think part of that says what are you seeing Steve on the propane side Are those numbers holding in as far as like on the product question kind of talking about different markets where you would go Wondering about either on the propane isobutane or some of these others how some of those markets right now look for marketing some of those production,5,81,1,0.0,0.012345679012345678,0.012345679012345678,0.0,0.012345679012345678,2.073197854,30.62,8906.208120000001,9,0.028079075,3.41362,2009-May-27,AZO
Okay So the way you presented that sort of below the growth line to me that looks like what some companies would call a discontinued operation or non core Is there any reconsideration about keeping this business,3,37,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02702702702702703,3.611934235,32.68,16010.02836,12,0.850369558,2.24991,2009-Jun-17,FDX
But from the revenue front typically we 've seen back {CARDINAL} of the year tend to be stronger than {DATE} Is there anything that would change that sort of outlook {DATE} Anything in LatAm in terms of some of the turbulence or anything you might be seeing there,3,48,1,0.0,0.020833333333333332,0.041666666666666664,0.020833333333333332,0.020833333333333332,3.611934235,32.68,16010.02836,12,0.850369558,2.24991,2009-Jun-17,FDX
Sure If we think about what you 've done in terms of buybacks {DATE} you bought back more in {DATE} and less in {DATE} I think {DATE} you did n't buy anything in {DATE} and part of the reason was the New York stat reserve addition If you do have to add to reserves would you continue to buy back stock or is that something that could affect your ability to hit the low end of your share buy back guidance,4,81,1,0.0,0.012345679012345678,0.012345679012345678,0.0,0.0,7.114672363,31.54,4291.073820000001,11,1.204788928,0.6843899999999999,2009-Jun-18,DFS
Good {TIME} and congratulations If you talk about the pricing environment to the pricing umbrella on the iPhone if you look at your addressable markets and {CARDINAL} subs that you currently address {PERCENT} of them are noncontractual markets Are those markets that you 're potentially interested in and how should we think about your addressable market if they 're a market that you 're priced too high for,3,68,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.014705882352941176,0.0,7.114672363,31.54,4291.073820000001,11,1.204788928,0.6843899999999999,2009-Jun-18,DFS
You 're thinking over {DATE} then before those LOCs mature,1,10,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.639181015,30.03,2885.6905,9,0.766525336,0.86534,2009-Jun-19,KMX
Thanks guys and good {TIME} I 'm going to actually keep it at {CARDINAL} question here Thinking about the cost side in the OR maybe from a different angle Mike is there anything in the budget process that says wow if we can sustain these growth rates we do need to start taking head count up we need to start hiring ahead of this When you laid out that initial guidance I think you said the last couple calls maybe {CARDINAL} basis points on the OR is sustainable in the long run If we get this type of better growth can we see better leverage on that cost structure,6,109,1,0.0,0.01834862385321101,0.01834862385321101,0.027522935779816515,0.009174311926605505,1.69381378,31.17,14208.64038,9,0.38075672,3.02441,2009-Jun-23,KR
I think in the past you and Miles I think it 's Miles I think I 've heard say that you would try to make up any dilution from the M&A is that still the case here,2,37,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.787128269,31.17,99994.3831,6,0.260790766,1.6536400000000002,2009-Jun-23,ORCL
Good {TIME} Just first of all congrats on a great {CARDINAL} Just a quick question on the tenant base You 've been talking very positively about what 's going on with the tenant base but just kind of curious Are there any retail categories where there are issues that you are worried about Are there any kind of tenants on a watchlist that you are worried about,6,67,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04477611940298507,0.014925373134328358,1.787128269,31.17,99994.3831,6,0.260790766,1.6536400000000002,2009-Jun-23,ORCL
And then I just wanted to again tie in something just in response to the last question just in terms of as with all this traffic coming in what were you can you give a sense of what you were seeing in terms of consumer behavior In terms of proclivity to spend Issues like that And give your sense about what the consumer is doing what they 're thinking,4,69,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.014492753623188406,2.510035336,30.58,20808.8564,3,0.313855535,0.76654,2009-Jun-24,NKE
First question kind of surrounds the gross margins and I just want to compliment you for breaking out the benefit from {DATE} some other builders have some builders have n't and I think it 's really helpful to benefit from prior impairments but with that I guess begs the question in {DATE} excluding the if I heard it right it was {DATE} but excluding the benefit it was closer to {PERCENT} {CARDINAL} I guess and that 's obviously a pretty steep drop from in some ways more than your peers I wanted to know if there was any obviously there are more incentives tougher pricing but given a bit steeper decline than maybe some of your peers I was wondering if you had a sense for any Company specific factors that might be driving that relative to the rest of the group or particularly aggressive spec reduction or if you could shed some light there,4,155,1,0.0,0.01935483870967742,0.01935483870967742,0.025806451612903226,0.03225806451612903,2.510035336,30.58,20808.8564,3,0.313855535,0.76654,2009-Jun-24,NKE
And if I could ask this last one Absolute pricing for managed care it 's pretty steady or has that gotten better or worse,2,24,1,0.0,0.041666666666666664,0.041666666666666664,0.041666666666666664,0.041666666666666664,3.301597805,30.58,3709.26517,6,0.425227337,4.58764,2009-Jun-24,RHT
And {CARDINAL} last thing on the balance sheet I know this is something we have talked about at length Given where your share price is trading is this not an opportunity to accelerate share repurchases,2,35,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02857142857142857,0.0,3.301597805,30.58,3709.26517,6,0.425227337,4.58764,2009-Jun-24,RHT
Okay fair enough Second question is on the guidance You had a good quarter You had the lease termination fee and you made some pretty attractive investments Just curious as to why you left guidance the same and what if anything offset some of the positive things that may have moved guidance somewhat upward,5,54,1,0.0,0.037037037037037035,0.037037037037037035,0.05555555555555555,0.037037037037037035,4.8860817260000005,29.05,4305.94762,6,1.91722259,1.33076,2009-Jun-25,MU
Okay And just finally do you think that the RTS category is strong enough that even if you do n't see significant share gains {DATE} that you could put up some decent growth through your new products and the like,2,40,1,0.0,0.025,0.025,0.05,0.0,4.8860817260000005,29.05,4305.94762,6,1.91722259,1.33076,2009-Jun-25,MU
Are you seeing any material change on the attitude on real estate taxes given the budget shortfall a lot of states and municipalities,1,23,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043478260869565216,1.791876592,29.05,8958.03693,1,0.6363024589999999,0.24392,2009-Jun-25,CAG

Okay {CARDINAL} last question on {DATE} how are you looking at this Are you just saying normal seasonality in the up turn usually higher than what you guided to Obviously if you look back over a {DATE} there are some pretty {DATE} moves when things turn down Are you kind of assuming normal seasonality with a hedge What exactly have you been seeing in {DATE} and {DATE} that makes you set that bar for {DATE} is that just a view of the macro or just curious as to how you set that,6,92,1,0.0,0.0,0.010869565217391304,0.0,0.010869565217391304,2.031033728,25.89,13480.90952,10,0.449104571,1.39056,2009-Jul-16,BIIB

Encouraging to see that the Caribbean and Europe seem to be pretty healthy and my question is just as we look towards the back {DATE} maybe looking at {DATE} as a guide here has the level of industry discounting and promotions has that accelerated or has that been pretty consistent,1,50,1,0.0,0.02,0.02,0.02,0.02,6.422917989,25.42,104306.4,11,1.972538975,0.28784,2009-Jul-17,BAC

OK And then your O&P Europe Asia and International business was up {DATE} over {DATE} With propane swinging into favor in {DATE} and {DATE} and I think it 's still in favor {DATE} and to what extent have you been able to take advantage of that And could you just kind of talk about your feed slate mix in Europe {DATE} given that you 're now free from some of those unfavorable naphtha contracts,4,74,1,0.0,0.013513513513513514,0.013513513513513514,0.02702702702702703,0.013513513513513514,2.185872426,24.34,29025.36624,6,0.473202521,0.81126,2009-Jul-20,TXN
I guess I just do n't understand if you 're starting out {DATE} knowing that you 're going to be below your long term plan and I realize compensation is a function of several plans or several different time periods why would you restate or accrue the comp at what I guess is essentially a normal {DATE} 's level Do you understand what I 'm saying,2,66,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.015151515151515152,5.171501031,24.34,3435.22953,11,2.071931311,2.77485,2009-Jul-20,LM
Okay Great thanks And maybe {CARDINAL} last question You talked about in the strength in close in demand Would you say that was more close in demand for Europe and China or was actually Caribbean close in showing some improvement too,5,41,1,0.0,0.024390243902439025,0.024390243902439025,0.07317073170731707,0.024390243902439025,4.3824251730000015,24.34,6369.09892,11,0.981252261,0.40228,2009-Jul-20,MTB
Okay Great How much impact was there just with the decline in crude prices Is that something that if crude prices stabilize or eventually increase is the capture rate going to switch there versus what we saw in {DATE},4,39,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05128205128205128,0.02564102564102564,2.790554695,24.4,10991.563999999997,9,0.227752235,3.26777,2009-Jul-21,SBUX
Great and then as you look at the price investments that took place during {DATE} was that planned throughout {DATE} was there something in the competitive environment that you needed to react to,1,33,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.030303030303030304,0.0,5.0671304180000005,24.4,23726.15052,11,0.641659518,0.70525,2009-Jul-21,STT

Okay and then just switching to the plant expansion for vitamins I might 've missed it did you quantify kind of what the top and bottom line hit was in {DATE} from that And then will there be any incremental hit in {DATE} I guess through {DATE},4,47,1,0.0,0.02127659574468085,0.02127659574468085,0.0,0.02127659574468085,1.695238579,24.4,15699.3395,10,0.351599944,1.10904,2009-Jul-21,SYK
So going forward as we look into {DATE} any material change in terms of where you think the trend is Holding pretty steady material opportunity improve,2,26,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07692307692307693,0.0,2.0752149280000003,24.4,51783.71892,3,0.314594827,0.34259,2009-Jul-21,UTX
When raw materials spiked up on the customers they did reformulation to try to lower their base material costs and that gave you an opportunity to go in adjust the fragrance package to match the new base materials with raw materials coming down is there a reformulation that occurs again That maybe allows you to get in and change your products and give you some mix effect here,2,68,1,0.0,0.014705882352941176,0.014705882352941176,0.014705882352941176,0.0,2.821645703,24.4,6767.30334,1,0.592603686,1.09329,2009-Jul-21,VFC
{CARDINAL} questions {CARDINAL} on the foundry applications you commented that there is still some design wins that you had What area in terms of etch application do you think you have the biggest opportunity in terms of incremental design wins,3,40,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.025,0.025,2.821645703,24.4,6767.30334,1,0.592603686,1.09329,2009-Jul-21,VFC
Quick question about the {DATE} guidance and acquisitions I think {DATE} you had talked about acquisitions collectively contributing {CARDINAL} of the earnings relative to your previous full year guidance Do you have an update to that now particularly because you just recently closed on the Bertoli piece as well which should I would think add to that,4,57,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03508771929824561,2.821645703,24.4,6767.30334,1,0.592603686,1.09329,2009-Jul-21,VFC
I just wanted to ask about this {MONEY} maybe in a little bit of a different way than was asked previously I do n't know if you are counting this differently because I remember you were saying at some point in {DATE} that {MONEY} was the baseline target And when things were the economy was better that was the number and when the economy was weaker you pushed that number up Are you did you at that point not include acquisition cost takeout Or is this {MONEY} just a big acceleration off of some of the value engineering and other things you talked about,5,104,1,0.0,0.009615384615384616,0.009615384615384616,0.009615384615384616,0.009615384615384616,4.301027478,24.4,23470.035,12,0.46936801,3.00456,2009-Jul-21,FCX
Okay Very good So the real question is now that we 've taken the salary hikes for {DATE} we have some utilization levers coming and assuming the rupee stays stable here in Is there anything I 'm missing Should we not have the capacity to have higher margins in if those {CARDINAL} things have occurred and or are stable at this point,4,62,1,0.0,0.0,0.016129032258064516,0.04838709677419355,0.016129032258064516,2.352604007,24.4,15515.9921,10,1.328094993,0.5137,2009-Jul-21,BSX

Okay fair enough And then maybe just lastly again trying to dig a little bit as to the restructuring and sort of the supply chain moves Any way to provide a little bit of clarity and maybe you do this on {DATE} but just in terms of the cadence of some of the manufacturing moves {DATE} that could potentially again either offset or manifest on the P&L {DATE},3,68,1,0.0,0.04411764705882353,0.04411764705882353,0.0,0.014705882352941176,2.317202574,23.87,19842.89732,3,0.44461184,0.5662,2009-Jul-22,ITW
And my questions to start off with are on operating margins following up with Paul You had operating margins {CARDINAL} It sounds like you are going increase that operating margin going forward to what {PERCENT} Where can you give us some kind of parameters there,4,45,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.022222222222222223,2.317202574,23.87,19842.89732,3,0.44461184,0.5662,2009-Jul-22,ITW
Okay thanks And then the second question from me was just regarding the dividend and how we should think about that going forward If you continue paying a {MONEY} {DATE} dividend then your dividend cover will be out {CARDINAL} times for {DATE} Are you comfortable with that and at that level going forwards or should we expect anything to change,4,60,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.016666666666666666,3.784233357,23.87,4159.35684,2,0.988583732,1.31394,2009-Jul-22,WHR

Okay I guess the follow up question would be on Clearing Bob You are doing a lot the investment in the EMCF and IBCG and clearing appears to be a more strategic value to exchanges I guess the question is I know that is there a broader strategy Can you tie all this together I know the EMCF Fortis was having some problems What that just sort of supporting them or is there a broader strategy that you have in your mind,7,82,1,0.0,0.012195121951219513,0.012195121951219513,0.0,0.036585365853658534,3.20518511,23.87,1908.57,6,0.68206495,3.30392,2009-Jul-22,SWKS
Thanks I was wondering if you could shed some light on your gross margin in {DATE} It looks like it 's been lower than it has been for some time Is there anything unusual there that I should focus on whether it 's customers demanding lower prices what have you or were there some {CARDINAL} time type of things in that And continuing on with that do you think it goes back to the the {CARDINAL} type of level {CARDINAL} flat type of level where it looks to have been over {DATE},5,92,1,0.0,0.010869565217391304,0.021739130434782608,0.0,0.0,6.250343438,23.87,5214.16544,12,1.361743092,3.5658300000000005,2009-Jul-22,HST

Okay And then just as my follow on given the tightness of advanced litho systems in the world {DATE} does that present an opportunity for Applied in stuff lined double patterning Are you seeing that gain traction with your customers Or do you have any thoughts there,4,47,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0425531914893617,0.0,5.182010873,23.87,4676.11416,12,0.358386558,0.67425,2009-Jul-22,DAL
Is it fair to say that that carries a pretty meaningfully above product gross margin relative to your overall business Is it a high {PERCENT} gross margin versus what you just reported,2,32,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.182010873,23.87,4676.11416,12,0.358386558,0.67425,2009-Jul-22,DAL

Okay and then I guess the last question At retail there 's a lot of favorable benefits from some creative promotions at retail such as whole house installations and the such what do you think the promotional environment or calendar might look like after the {DATE} price increases go through and how price sensitive do you believe the consumer is right now Jeff,2,63,1,0.0,0.015873015873015872,0.031746031746031744,0.031746031746031744,0.015873015873015872,2.8820158310000004,23.47,29858.13915,12,1.06962597,0.39321,2009-Jul-23,UNP

Good {TIME} everybody {CARDINAL} quick questions First on the Value Added services can you give us a color or any particular services or verticals that are driving that growth,3,29,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.034482758620689655,0.034482758620689655,4.053470146,23.47,21518.42904,5,0.368071196,2.18988,2009-Jul-23,MOS
Steve what is clear over {DATE} and specifically {DATE} is MedSurg is clearly accelerating I know you 've tried to talk us away from thinking about your {DATE} comps but it does look like it 's accelerating What 's less clear to us is the pieces that are accelerated the pieces that are doing well There is actually a fair amount of inorganic stuff in there now between Ascent as well as Gaymar Can you help us draw a picture between the core Stryker and Endoscopy and beds and the more recent Stryker which is some of the new acquisitions,5,100,1,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.694945172,23.47,44851.42581,10,0.248080109,4.89234,2009-Jul-23,MMM
I guess one of the things I wanted to ask about was just relative to your desire or willingness or opportunities in sort of the non iPad tablets Obviously it was a good growth driver for you We saw the same situation there that we 've seen in other leading edge products as they become a little more commoditized How about the next generation Is there opportunities there outside of the market leader for you to participate Or does that start out as a commoditized product,6,86,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046511627906976744,0.0,1.210670418,23.47,7343.823,10,0.317283484,1.23775,2009-Jul-23,LH
Okay and then just last question regarding EIS it seemed like you put up pretty good margins in that segment in the business Just wanted to get a sense for how that might work in terms of is that a project by project basis and maybe that 's pushing the margins up a little bit there Or is that something we can extrapolate going forward,3,65,1,0.0,0.03076923076923077,0.03076923076923077,0.015384615384615385,0.015384615384615385,1.210670418,23.47,7343.823,10,0.317283484,1.23775,2009-Jul-23,LH
And then are you able to comment at all on that China book to bill And just kind of latest trends there I know you talked qualitatively about it a minute ago but,4,33,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.030303030303030304,0.0,1.210670418,23.47,7343.823,10,0.317283484,1.23775,2009-Jul-23,LH
Great And could you speak to the timing of asset sales Is it a this {DATE} event or is this over {DATE} or what have you,3,26,1,0.0,0.038461538461538464,0.038461538461538464,0.038461538461538464,0.0,1.260556368,23.47,22557.65876,3,0.186629566,0.3166,2009-Jul-23,KMB
Okay And just {CARDINAL} last question Ford and GM are could be moving to a or transmission is that a positive trend for the traditional clutch business,3,27,1,0.0,0.037037037037037035,0.037037037037037035,0.037037037037037035,0.037037037037037035,2.726445657,23.47,5258.31189,6,0.50689096,1.47493,2009-Jul-23,KLAC
Hey how you doing So you mentioned about how you 're running a matched book but at the same time you will benefit from higher reinvestment rates Are you able to highlight the sensitivity to the net interest spread assuming say a {CARDINAL} point parallel upward shift in the yield curve,3,51,1,0.0,0.0,0.0196078431372549,0.0392156862745098,0.0,2.726445657,23.47,5258.31189,6,0.50689096,1.47493,2009-Jul-23,KLAC
So are you saying you are adding munis to the mix Or you 're just adding munis within the mix of your normal loan portfolio,2,25,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.132412159,23.47,13328.391,6,0.639827765,1.5713,2009-Jul-23,JNPR
Thank you As a follow on normally on these calls we do n't talk about what 's happening down at the STB except with respect to the reciprocal switching proposal but there are a couple of rate cases there that currently involve Norfolk Southern {CARDINAL} is the DuPont case and there 's a smaller one the Sunbelt case How long do think it 'll be before those cases are resolved How do you characterize the risk associated with those cases,5,80,1,0.0,0.0,0.0125,0.0,0.0,3.132412159,23.47,13328.391,6,0.639827765,1.5713,2009-Jul-23,JNPR
And last one as you guys think about NextEra as a whole how comfortable is the Board with the idea of prospectively changing the rate of growth for the consolidated Company from {PERCENT} to something else if you were to allocate more growth to the Yieldco design,1,47,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.79168333,23.47,4710.520320000001,4,1.500839262,1.36353,2009-Jul-23,NFX
And then finally your stock has moved up a lot Any thoughts of a stock split I know it 's a cosmetic question but just since I 've got you on the phone,3,33,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.030303030303030304,1.721926048,23.47,17729.25429,6,0.444980839,2.99466,2009-Jul-23,RTN
Okay Maybe more specifically with HCA and BMI do you think that those are opportunities or even with Spire that you would expect to see happen over {DATE} or is this something that you think could take a little bit longer to play out,2,44,1,0.0,0.045454545454545456,0.045454545454545456,0.022727272727272728,0.0,3.201094898,23.47,7010.26422,4,0.6065906679999999,0.47156,2009-Jul-23,RRC
So {CARDINAL} question for you on the margin and the very strong performance {DATE} if you add back the WoodMac closing costs it would put you {PERCENT} And I know that when you started out {DATE} with a {PERCENT} to {PERCENT} long term target and then after the sale of Interthinx it went up to {PERCENT} to {PERCENT} range Given that strong performance in {DATE} adjusted for WoodMac and the fact that the gross to net and healthcare is n't yet in the numbers should we be thinking about that upper end of that range moving up going forward,3,99,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.020202020202020204,0.020202020202020204,3.201094898,23.47,7010.26422,4,0.6065906679999999,0.47156,2009-Jul-23,RRC
So {PERCENT} makes sense on an ongoing basis So your view is we should n't get too caught up in this usage comp right now because there 's going to be some friction in the weather adjustments,2,37,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.780216877,23.47,11996.88704,1,0.554884551,3.90843,2009-Jul-23,RAI^G17
Thanks very much Was there a revenue benefit to ag productivity from the Scotts deal And if there was how much was it Secondly if you spend {MONEY} to expand dicamba capacity how many gallons do you get for {MONEY},4,40,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.025,0.0,1.814885473,23.47,10702.39335,12,0.46357118,0.57562,2009-Jul-23,OMC
The other thing as you look at the general soup category I guess this gets to Andrew 's question about the value messaging it seems to already be taking place in the market share from what we can see in the sense that condensed seems to be gaining overall market share within the total soup category Is that what you 're seeing as well and if that is the case how do you look at that Is that something you would expect to exploit going forward,3,86,1,0.0,0.0,0.023255813953488372,0.011627906976744186,0.023255813953488372,3.195497576,23.47,13915.29996,3,0.57077443,4.661969999999998,2009-Jul-23,NUE
Okay But I guess what I 'm asking is if it I understand that you tend to haul on the smaller carriers Has something changed in terms of the availability of that capacity that 's pushing rates higher Is there less of that capacity to hire now versus when we 've seen prior recoveries in volumes,4,56,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.195497576,23.47,13915.29996,3,0.57077443,4.661969999999998,2009-Jul-23,NUE
Okay that 's great to hear If could I ask {CARDINAL} last question the equity in JV that number at {MONEY} in {DATE} versus {MONEY} {DATE} I would have thought that the improvements in OWN would have driven some improvement in that line {DATE} but we did n't see it I was wondering if you could explain what happened there And also from an accounting perspective I think you 're we 're accruing {PERCENT} of the OWN results for awhile That might change as they start to recoup your losses in excess of your cost base So how do we see the accounting changing there over {DATE},9,107,1,0.0,0.028037383177570093,0.028037383177570093,0.028037383177570093,0.018691588785046728,2.657735583,23.47,20107.3705,12,0.451270851,0.56287,2009-Jul-23,NEM
Thanks Hi everyone Question on the website and what you 're doing with social media Looks like there 's been a recent redesign of the website I could be wrong but looks different to me So is that the case And then with marketing maybe you could talk through what you are doing with social media Facebook and Pinterest and those kinds of things And do you feel like what you 're doing is having much of an impact on the business particularly the juniors business which continues to be very strong,8,92,1,0.0,0.03260869565217391,0.03260869565217391,0.010869565217391304,0.021739130434782608,2.657735583,23.47,20107.3705,12,0.451270851,0.56287,2009-Jul-23,NEM
And just last one for me I wanted to catch up on the M&A pipeline because it felt for a period of time like you guys had opened the aperture a little bit in terms of opportunities you were willing to consider obviously staying disciplined in evaluating those opportunities But would you say there 's been any directional move in the pipeline in terms of it being closer to bearing fruit versus not in {DATE},3,75,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02666666666666667,0.0,2.0974040940000003,23.47,21633.06796,5,0.137558346,0.18257,2009-Jul-23,CELG
I guess just sort of following up on that when you look at the futures orders that you reported {DATE} are there any sequential trends to call out overall or by regions,1,32,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.092881229,23.47,4471.8063,3,0.297102806,3.0037,2009-Jul-23,BLL
My question relates to virtualization And just trying to understand the role of hosting Windows guests in the future what your expectation is and how actively you would expect to be involved in that,2,34,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.029411764705882353,2.092881229,23.47,4471.8063,3,0.297102806,3.0037,2009-Jul-23,BLL
Okay so given all that kind of lack of visibility in the business what gives you confidence that you are going to be able to cut it 's loss in {CARDINAL} in {DATE} Is it because you have got the {CARDINAL} to {CARDINAL} system in the rear view mirror now or is it are you beginning to show a little bit better sales growth rate so that you expect a little bit more leverage or other cost savings,2,78,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02564102564102564,0.038461538461538464,4.7562775880000006,23.47,33580.895,11,0.5502834839999999,1.6766900000000002,2009-Jul-23,AXP
What was the total of that and any terms on that type of debt I mean your maturity range interest rates,2,21,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.7562775880000006,23.47,33580.895,11,0.5502834839999999,1.6766900000000002,2009-Jul-23,AXP
In terms of the slowdown across the emerging markets was that tilted towards {DATE} Was it sort of consistent throughout {DATE} Any thoughts there,3,24,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041666666666666664,8.244351765,23.47,5575.14413,11,1.643037139,15.42195,2009-Jul-23,FITB
And just last question I guess maybe for Jeff Berkes if he 's on the line Are there any I guess the phrase green chutes of opportunistic acquisitions out there Maybe you have the pension portfolios or banks or is it still a little too early for that,4,48,1,0.0,0.041666666666666664,0.041666666666666664,0.0,0.041666666666666664,1.87333322,23.47,20422.6164,6,0.544209863,2.82843,2009-Jul-23,DHR
And then finally Jeff I think you addressed it in {DATE} and actually I 'm just looking at my notes and I do n't have it clearly On your last slide you talked about driving people to compensation as it relates to these metrics Obviously all we are seeing on the slide is kind of the triple plus for {DATE} But what is it exactly that people will be compensated for And how are they being measured,6,77,1,0.012987012987012988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.976895372,23.43,69116.43239,4,0.333602471,1.67188,2009-Jul-24,SLB
Okay To change but still talk about the future a little bit you highlighted the JLTV progress that you 've made How do you sort of envision your ability to continue to both serve the longer term needs of the Army but also my sense is the move into Afghanistan and so on is probably stressing the force and what sort of responsive actions are you taking to help the military in that region,3,74,1,0.0,0.0,0.013513513513513514,0.013513513513513514,0.02702702702702703,3.866586632,23.43,3282.05592,5,0.7219744659999999,3.69781,2009-Jul-24,EMN
Hey guys Just thinking about the CapEx budget Are you more than likely what your customers are wanting to lean towards processing fractionation maybe a little more commodity sensitive businesses or more the fee based gas pipeline kind of things What are you seeing in the market right now,4,49,1,0.0,0.02040816326530612,0.02040816326530612,0.0,0.0,2.470769144,23.43,6793.30432,3,0.670791569,2.4595700000000003,2009-Jul-24,DOV
Switching gears to the investment portfolio we realize you guys take a lot of care there and investing in AAA and AA quality securities But with the recent concerns that have sprung up in the munis market is that causing you to take or to look to any additional safeguards,2,50,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02,2.470769144,23.43,6793.30432,3,0.670791569,2.4595700000000003,2009-Jul-24,DOV
Well I guess the other way to ask it then is it is it fair to say that given the product momentum that it sounds like you guys think you have do you think that versus {DATE} that you 're feeling more comfortable that that growth without giving a level that you feel like you feel comfortable it 's accelerated versus your potential has accelerated versus what it was {DATE},3,70,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.738948793,26.18,7682.7184,6,0.273412531,1.02936,2009-Aug-19,NTAP
Thank you Kevin just a few questions You spoke about the recent improvements in sales trends and I am just wondering {DATE} we had talked about the lack of loyalty among non credit card customers What are you seeing in terms of where the sales improvement is coming from Is it greater share from your loyal credit card customers or the less loyal customers are coming back,6,67,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07462686567164178,0.029850746268656716,2.738948793,26.18,7682.7184,6,0.273412531,1.02936,2009-Aug-19,NTAP
This is actually Steven Kwok filling in for Sanjay I guess the question I have was with regards to seasonality Aside from the movements in the operating margins on the international and the North America side how should we think about the EPS on a {DATE} basis Should we expect it to kind of steadily rise or are there ups and downs due to seasonality,4,65,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.015384615384615385,1.87276783,26.26,5584.28544,9,0.29187785,0.39344,2009-Aug-20,ROST
Okay And if I can just follow up on it so I think you guys are comping the American Airlines {DATE} So taking that in context with the comment on the EBITDA growth for the first half versus {DATE} is there any additional investment that you 're making Or is it just the seasonality is a little more accentuated now that Trip is not in the mix,4,67,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.87276783,26.26,5584.28544,9,0.29187785,0.39344,2009-Aug-20,ROST
Okay that 's {DATE} I thought I was for the second {CARDINAL} Okay And then it 's been really impressive to see how much stock you 've bought back over {DATE} evident in the share price performance Looking forward can you just remind us how you think about buying back stock versus potentially special dividend versus potentially a more incremental sustainable dividend,4,62,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.016129032258064516,0.0,1.87276783,26.26,5584.28544,9,0.29187785,0.39344,2009-Aug-20,ROST
And then with the maturities coming due have you taken any proactive steps to hedge out any interest rate risk around those re fies,1,24,1,0.0,0.0,0.041666666666666664,0.041666666666666664,0.0,1.87276783,26.26,5584.28544,9,0.29187785,0.39344,2009-Aug-20,ROST
Okay and then finally you mentioned something intriguing about SG&A spending popping up in {DATE} I thought I heard prototyping in the middle of that list Can you describe that at all,3,32,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.310976361,26.26,4999.8424,1,0.5280911389999999,1.63701,2009-Aug-20,HRL
And then just on the inventory front I know you guys were underinventoried this time {DATE} So when we look at the increase at {PERCENT} I guess how much of that is catch up to getting to where you should be versus just being heavy because of a soft and is the mix of the excess inventory primarily seasonal,2,59,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.310976361,26.26,4999.8424,1,0.5280911389999999,1.63701,2009-Aug-20,HRL
Great thanks for that color and just a question on the fuel rewards program Have you made any significant changes to the fuel rewards promotions particularly as more and more competitors roll out these similar programs,2,36,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08333333333333333,0.027777777777777776,1.804435749,27.1,5703.24888,11,0.277930887,0.79907,2009-Sep-04,HRB

Okay That 's helpful And I think in the past over {DATE} when you guys have been asked where pricing is running in core payroll it seems like you 've indicated it 's been closer to the lower end of that longer term {PERCENT} range that you had laid out at the analyst meeting {DATE} Was that the case again during {DATE},4,62,1,0.0,0.0,0.016129032258064516,0.0,0.0,1.459726005,24.06,9895.20455,1,0.6363024589999999,1.24296,2009-Sep-22,CAG

Okay and I appreciate that And the thing that really stands out would be for example the Mississippian play Where I wonder is it was more of a near term capital efficiency versus say a better longer term return that gets a little bit more activity relative to the long term returns in that play {DATE},3,56,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03571428571428571,0.0,2.631673327,24.06,20030.208,12,1.158507734,3.5880300000000003,2009-Sep-22,CCL

Frank I 'm seeing a little bit of a transformation and how the macro cycle is playing out relative to the last couple of cycles I 'm wondering if you 've seen any changes in competitive landscape of any of the businesses In particular with respect to your categorization of the portfolio as serving the top of the top of the markets served I 'm wondering if you are seeing any mix down in solution selection to mid tier solutions by any of the customer bases,4,86,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.6149456130000002,23.08,4552.3197,1,0.707167565,2.76637,2009-Sep-23,CTAS
Okay So Jim going back to what you said earlier about booking sales that do n't ship for {DATE} Is there an opportunity there to bring in some of those lead times again because your inventories are so low and it does n't seem like there 's a lack of demand with the available supply out there,3,57,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.017543859649122806,0.017543859649122806,1.6422544469999998,23.49,11217.29728,12,0.137221552,0.13883,2009-Sep-24,PAYX
Yes okay That 's helpful And then I guess the other question is on the I guess the financial resources that one of the rules that the CFTC put out was changing or recommending how clearing houses calculate their financial resources particularly around limiting the ability to assess clients or assess dealers Any thoughts on how that differs from how you do it {DATE} and whether that 's going to require more capital clearing house,4,75,1,0.0,0.0,0.013333333333333334,0.0,0.013333333333333334,1.372048851,25.61,3766.5418,12,0.388350092,0.8402200000000001,2009-Oct-01,GPN

A couple questions first First with respect to retail {DATE} you beat many of your competitors to market on the back to school promotions The sense was {DATE} that many of them went earlier Any way to quantify to say that shift what impact that may have had on your comps in,4,52,1,0.0,0.019230769230769232,0.019230769230769232,0.0,0.019230769230769232,1.569042131,23.01,112608.0,6,0.479942584,2.07147,2009-Oct-13,INTC
You just have to market it better to the commercial customers it that what you are saying Jim,2,18,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05555555555555555,0.0,2.299938631,22.99,17382.51252,12,1.126385873,0.94806,2009-Oct-14,CSX
So when you look forward and you talked {PERCENT} margins {DATE} and I was assuming that that was {PERCENT} including restructuring before are you on a track for something like that Then when you look long term at the {PERCENT} goal that you 've described is that all pretty much intact Or long term could it even be stronger given what you have done,3,64,1,0.0,0.015625,0.03125,0.015625,0.015625,2.299938631,22.99,17382.51252,12,1.126385873,0.94806,2009-Oct-14,CSX

It is Paul Choi filling in for Michael Hi guys Maybe first if we could touch on surgeon training programs We have seen some changes in the way your competitors are responding to the DOJ settlement for instance reinstating physician training programs is there anything you guys are doing different going forward now and how is physician training on Cormet going at this point,4,64,1,0.0,0.03125,0.03125,0.0,0.0,1.862149137,22.99,6625.2598,6,0.344884751,0.45214,2009-Oct-14,XLNX

And Jon could you update us on gross margin Was that negatively impacted again this {DATE} or was a majority of these sales into the higher margin markets Is now accretive to corporate margins,3,34,1,0.0,0.029411764705882353,0.029411764705882353,0.0,0.029411764705882353,1.111489005,21.72,5476.736999999999,11,0.866733978,0.72928,2009-Oct-16,PBCT
Doing well doing well Quick modeling question I think investors were a little bit spooked with the increase in cost {DATE} I know you talked about it a little bit in your commentary and the presentation with higher workover and production tax Can you peel back the onion a little bit more and discuss where you saw higher operating costs and what we should think about is recurring versus non recurring in context of maintenance versus servicing,5,77,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.012987012987012988,1.111489005,21.72,5476.736999999999,11,0.866733978,0.72928,2009-Oct-16,PBCT
Good {TIME} and congrats on {DATE} As it relates to revenue growth much of it came from the transactional hardware businesses in {DATE} There were obviously a number of catalysts through {DATE} Can you talk about whether that demand strength continued into {DATE} and whether you saw anything different between the commercial and consumer segments in {DATE},4,57,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03508771929824561,0.0,2.7426562210000003,21.72,156593.8695,11,1.972538975,0.42359,2009-Oct-16,BAC
Hi most of my questions have been asked But I just wanted {CARDINAL} clarification on your comments regarding the target rating Now obviously if you sell this business you can keep the triple B positive rating at the rating agencies I would think But in terms of your targeted rating are you still looking at triple B flat or better or now that you 're not going to get the commodity business you 're looking at triple B positive and would like to stay there,4,85,1,0.0,0.0,0.011764705882352941,0.03529411764705882,0.011764705882352941,2.7426562210000003,21.72,156593.8695,11,1.972538975,0.42359,2009-Oct-16,BAC
And then the second part your revenues were up a little bit in {CARDINAL} in the Mohawk segment but your op margin was much lower than {DATE} Is {DATE} more reflective of what we should expect moving forward Or is {DATE} operational results more reflective of what we should expect,3,50,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.7426562210000003,21.72,156593.8695,11,1.972538975,0.42359,2009-Oct-16,BAC
How about with the analog being up {DATE} far exceeding the market Are they being tied to the same {CARDINAL} bit controllers or is it just the general lift that you 're getting in the new products,2,37,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.477182332,21.43,2478.3516600000007,11,1.74024674,0.51882,2009-Oct-19,ZION
Great thanks and then you also got great SG&A leverage in your temporary business Was that just higher revenue with kind of a flattish employee base or are you seeing greater productivity gains Can you give some color there,4,39,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10256410256410256,0.0,1.314038412,21.49,121349.5911,10,0.505910774,2.75984,2009-Oct-20,PFE
Okay so it is mutually exclusive Last question What is the risk of owning {PERCENT} of the management company Knowing the bogey is {CARDINAL} what could happen to trip that number and then what would happen in that circumstance,4,39,1,0.0,0.02564102564102564,0.05128205128205128,0.02564102564102564,0.02564102564102564,2.308933068,21.49,25837.05025,11,0.641659518,0.23768000000000006,2009-Oct-20,STT
Just a quick question on the reduction in the cash flow guidance which you said was attributable to the lower Citation deliveries Does that reflect a more sizable cut to your anticipated deliveries versus production How should we think about the mismatch there and if that 's really just inventory that will build up over the course of {DATE},3,59,1,0.0,0.0,0.01694915254237288,0.0,0.05084745762711865,2.308933068,21.49,25837.05025,11,0.641659518,0.23768000000000006,2009-Oct-20,STT
Thanks It 's Nick Yulico on the line Turning back to the revenue guidance for {DATE} I was hoping you could provide some of the major factors that get you to the bottom middle or top end of that range I mean is the big sensitivity where job growth settles out,4,51,1,0.0,0.0196078431372549,0.0196078431372549,0.0,0.0,2.308933068,21.49,25837.05025,11,0.641659518,0.23768000000000006,2009-Oct-20,STT
Great that 's helpful And then I was curious I know you do n't give forward guidance but some companies have talked about weather and holiday timing in {DATE} and {DATE} being and having a negative impact on their business and I 'm curious as we think about is that something that we should potentially consider as we adjust our models going forward,3,63,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.015873015873015872,0.015873015873015872,1.226003893,21.49,61596.90512,3,0.314594827,0.67765,2009-Oct-20,UTX
Yes hey good {TIME} everyone {CARDINAL} questions here I think Ed when you were going through your commentary you talked about particularly you saw particularly the strength in the New York markets What is behind this And maybe this is for Glen as well Was this the startup of the Virgin business Is this the growth in corporate share Is this LaGuardia really starting to mature now What drove that,9,70,1,0.0,0.014285714285714285,0.014285714285714285,0.02857142857142857,0.014285714285714285,1.288047132,21.49,14283.53861,10,0.449104571,3.91243,2009-Oct-20,BIIB
Fair enough Rick follow up question on the SG&A. A large part of the year to {DATE} reduction in the SG&A looks to be in the corporate overhead line Can you explain where some of those savings are coming from and speak to the additional opportunities in corporate overhead,4,49,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02040816326530612,0.02040816326530612,1.288047132,21.49,14283.53861,10,0.449104571,3.91243,2009-Oct-20,BIIB

So thinking about that line item into {DATE} I think you said Sovaldi and hep C spending was a substantive part of that growth If hep C spending is going to either continue to grow into {DATE} or if the payer community comes together and competes it down will this line item move as hep C and specialty drug spending will move I guess that makes sense right,3,68,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.267005087,20.9,4009.2624,12,0.313077571,1.93437,2009-Oct-21,RHI

Okay And then on the internal growth side obviously raised the same capital outlook by {CARDINAL} basis points Now in past presentations you 've talked about sort of an ongoing business model that talks about sort of {PERCENT} growth I guess is there any reason to think that {DATE} should stray significantly from what we saw here in {DATE} and sort of relative to that longer term outlook,4,68,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.220649393,20.9,44200.11084,11,2.049951817,0.96055,2009-Oct-21,MS

Great {DATE} Just wanted to get into the guidance a little bit from the standpoint of I know {DATE} your initial plan was basically the same comp guidance for {DATE} Are you thinking there 's the opportunity to deliver this type of upside again Not to hold you to it at this early stage but is there anything that is becoming from a market share standpoint you 're seeing some of the full price retailers doing a little bit better Do you think is that still the biggest opportunity for upside and earnings from sales and leveraging fixed costs,5,99,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04040404040404041,0.0,3.348540985,24.83,12784.92376,6,0.134407532,0.22039,2009-Oct-28,FSLR

Thank you Good {TIME} You talked about {QUANTITY} that are core of core in the Marcellus And that in the slide that you go through you also highlight the larger circle that encompasses the core Can you talk about your acreage position and what you would call the core in northeast Pennsylvania and how you are thinking about developing those acres versus selling those acres,5,65,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.015384615384615385,0.0,1.38088706,27.91,4558.13474,3,0.297102806,2.30762,2009-Oct-29,BLL
I was just sort of more comparing it to like Waters for example Their numbers were a little bit there That 's fine I 'll take it as more CapEx and NMR in that sense On the Diagnostics and Genomics business the gross margin in that business has been down {DATE} on {DATE} despite the fact that organic revenue growth is a lot has been a lot better than expected in that segment at least to my models I guess is that due to product launches FX could you talk a little more about what 's going on Ultimately where does the gross margin in that business sort of go to,6,111,1,0.0,0.009009009009009009,0.009009009009009009,0.018018018018018018,0.0,2.107194927,27.91,2153.17035,6,0.973367614,2.62631,2009-Oct-29,PKI
Great And I also wanted to ask about in your product mix you folks mentioned having had some success in some of your move up and your luxury product I also noticed that you mentioned the decline in your mortgage subsidiary in terms of the first time buyer going from {PERCENT} So I wanted I should ask about your product mix strategy going forward here Obviously you have shifted more towards the move up buyers Is that something you expect to continue And is that stat out of the mortgage subsidiary is that just an anomaly {DATE} or is that reflective of a product 's mix shift,7,107,1,0.0,0.0,0.009345794392523364,0.018691588785046728,0.018691588785046728,3.175907313,27.91,552.57632,12,0.7048741409999999,0.87946,2009-Oct-29,URI
Jim could you give us a little bit more qualitative commentary about pricing and margins that you expect over {DATE} within the electrical segment Obviously margins were very strong in {DATE} and recognizing obviously there was some weather impact there but qualitatively can you just comment on where we stand on pricing and margins for electrical over {DATE},2,58,1,0.0,0.017241379310344827,0.017241379310344827,0.017241379310344827,0.0,2.403673695,27.91,19908.2555,12,0.451270851,3.63776,2009-Oct-29,NEM
And if I could just sneak {CARDINAL} more in on the separation {DATE} the value of the business combination you have made it abundantly clear just maybe a little more thinking on the shareholder value of doing this outside of Danaher rather than within Danaher,1,45,1,0.0,0.044444444444444446,0.044444444444444446,0.0,0.0,2.403673695,27.91,19908.2555,12,0.451270851,3.63776,2009-Oct-29,NEM
Just a follow up on the commentary on land spend I think you guys said you 're largely looking at replacement land to the land that 's being delivered Would this indicate a continued deceleration in {DATE} community count openings,3,40,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.070023212,27.91,11605.32735,8,0.992317256,3.52771,2009-Oct-29,NBL
That 's very helpful Then my second question is just on the Systems the revenues were weak but it sounded like very much in line with your planning assumption It does n't sound like your {DATE} view has changed on that segment so I just wondered if you could confirm that Also any color at all on the linearity of the sales progression Is it going to be a very very year at Systems because of the TAP delivery schedule or do we start to see things improve a bit by {DATE},5,92,1,0.0,0.010869565217391304,0.021739130434782608,0.010869565217391304,0.021739130434782608,2.304280797,27.91,6106.58639,11,0.500186004,0.44639,2009-Oct-29,VTR
Okay that 's very helpful Thank you Alan and I understand you are going to be doing a deep dive here quite shortly but is there any additional color perhaps to share say for instance on Appalachian Connector at this point whether it 's on a slow burn or is there anything incremental to add at this point,3,58,1,0.0,0.017241379310344827,0.017241379310344827,0.0,0.017241379310344827,2.304280797,27.91,6106.58639,11,0.500186004,0.44639,2009-Oct-29,VTR
Okay And then just the {PERCENT} HRS growth obviously continues to be really good But is that a clean like for like number or was there a little bit of benefit still from the mix with the minimum premium health plan or is that really,3,45,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044444444444444446,0.0,2.304280797,27.91,6106.58639,11,0.500186004,0.44639,2009-Oct-29,VTR

Okay Then in terms of capital management how are you thinking about deploying capital beyond sort of the more traditional deal flow Are you seeing some opportunities to do something a bit out of the box if you will just given the strength of the balance sheet And at what point do you maybe start to circle back to share repurchases,4,61,1,0.0,0.01639344262295082,0.01639344262295082,0.03278688524590164,0.0,2.43874231,27.91,18972.1645,11,0.356481128,2.79062,2009-Oct-29,AFL
And in the past you 'd also mentioned that with that you start shifting resources away from dealing with the warning letter Has that started to happen already or you just do n't want to do that until the official lifting happens,2,42,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.023809523809523808,1.616403022,27.91,5374.4726,10,0.394993056,0.13484000000000002,2009-Oct-29,XRAY
All right If I can do {CARDINAL} more Larry with potential capital management because you had a dividend that was higher before is there any preference by the Board or yourself of dividend versus buyback if the economy does support that decision,2,42,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.616403022,27.91,5374.4726,10,0.394993056,0.13484000000000002,2009-Oct-29,XRAY
A few questions a lot have been asked and answered On the supply chain improvement in North America I 'm just wondering how we should view the transition period Meaning is the production ramp still a little bit constrained,3,39,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02564102564102564,0.02564102564102564,2.78834162,24.76,3181.60248,1,1.215553312,0.5725899999999999,2009-Oct-30,MHK
So it feels like {DATE} 's really taking a nice step up and manufacturing which seemed to be the early improvement area for you is doing well but cooled off I 'm just wondering when we look at manufacturing and suite adoption as we move forward should we see some reacceleration or it has reached a steady state in terms what you 're thinking for the growth for manufacturing,2,69,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.014492753623188406,0.0,2.995035205,24.76,19167.22256,11,0.209368949,1.16472,2009-Oct-30,SPG
Can you talk a little bit more about the Culberson County area Where do you feel I know it 's {DATE} but where do you feel these potential {CARDINAL} zones could spread out Do you think their perspective across the entire {QUANTITY} you have here,3,45,1,0.0,0.022222222222222223,0.022222222222222223,0.0,0.0,2.811651628,24.76,15808.60021,4,0.324632113,0.032510000000000004,2009-Oct-30,SWN
Hi Thanks {CARDINAL} small business related questions First I saw you bumped up the guide for {DATE} You did n't comment on the {CARDINAL} number for ending I am wondering just given the outperformance here the pace at which you 're adding subs how should we be thinking about that {CARDINAL} number that you are thinking out in {DATE},6,59,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01694915254237288,2.4180163340000003,24.76,7930.114640000002,12,1.023415907,1.46564,2009-Oct-30,WY
Got it And then on the capital allocation I think Mike you mentioned that once you get the debt paid down get down to under {CARDINAL} times debt to EBITDAR that you go back to the traditional capital allocation strategy Could you remind us of what that is And then also if I remember correctly it tended to bounce around between maybe {CARDINAL} and {CARDINAL} times debt to EBITDAR Could you remind us what that was and how you look at it now,5,83,1,0.0,0.03614457831325301,0.03614457831325301,0.0,0.0,3.99434103,24.76,1542.62674,11,0.537997658,0.01065,2009-Oct-30,AIV
And do you see anything from the competition or anything out there that makes you think that it might be more challenging to maintain what appears to be a very high level of market share going forward,1,37,1,0.0,0.05405405405405406,0.05405405405405406,0.0,0.02702702702702703,3.99434103,24.76,1542.62674,11,0.537997658,0.01065,2009-Oct-30,AIV
Hi just {CARDINAL} more to clean up on the Mancos area is there anything in terms of topography or what are the challenges of operating in that region,1,28,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03571428571428571,0.83003075,24.76,20613.57676,8,0.6802675509999999,3.12571,2009-Oct-30,D

Okay And then could I ask how you are thinking about the dividend because the dividend does obviously reflect your long term earnings capability but in this environment where you are triangulating between different investor needs and capital needs how are you thinking about that going forward,2,47,1,0.0,0.02127659574468085,0.02127659574468085,0.0,0.0,1.501415655,29.78,5079.01009,6,0.012459903,1.45034,2009-Nov-03,PBI

Okay And then just lastly I 'll turn it over Tom I was hoping that you could help us to provide some color in the Pacific Northwest some of trade publications have shown a pretty steady climb {DATE} after {DATE} after {DATE} on on log prices and I 'm curious if you could just help us to understand some of the moving parts whether it 's the impact of the Canadian Dollar or beetle kill in BC and the impact its having whether it is an export issue or domestic demand What are some of the drivers that you are seeing in the Pacific northwest {DATE},5,106,1,0.0,0.018867924528301886,0.018867924528301886,0.0,0.0,1.414528824,28.81,3892.20042,8,0.97572902,5.82835,2009-Nov-04,OKE
So it 's fair to say that as you guys are planning for {DATE} you guys are thinking those {CARDINAL} dynamics {CARDINAL} a mix shift back to the enterprise and one with new products can drive end market pricing back up and should help you guys drive your ASPs up as well,1,52,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.414528824,28.81,3892.20042,8,0.97572902,5.82835,2009-Nov-04,OKE
I guess it is still good {TIME} although it is getting to be {TIME} Congratulations on finishing the year on such a good note in terms of performance versus expectations A couple of things that I would like to address as most of my questions have been answered The profitability of the Global Group we 've seen the decline obviously There was a restructuring and dissolution costs there What are you how do you think about margins in the Global Group in {DATE} and is it likely to be influenced by volume coming back by foreign exchange or excuse me by raw material costs,6,104,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.028846153846153848,0.038461538461538464,2.595634736,28.81,6691.24866,11,1.0388171,0.06936,2009-Nov-04,UNM
Just trying to tie some of the comments on {CARDINAL} you talked about a healthy {CARDINAL} but you need a pickup in the economy quarter versus quarter I know it would have been early but did you think about providing maybe {CARDINAL} guidance at this point to help investors out a little bit more,2,54,1,0.0,0.018518518518518517,0.018518518518518517,0.0,0.0,1.207885362,28.81,16735.7549,10,0.312092191,0.23196,2009-Nov-04,BDX
My first yes my first question relates to your comments that as that if the recovery occurs in {CARDINAL} which I think it will but if it does you expected it to be not uniform across the country some markets will outperform others and that sort of thing I was curious as to whether or not you could give us an idea the markets which you are seeing or anticipating to see greater stronger trends what is your margin profile look like in those markets understanding that some geographies tend to have better margin profiles generally speaking,2,97,1,0.0,0.010309278350515464,0.020618556701030927,0.041237113402061855,0.010309278350515464,2.027055847,28.81,29490.51,4,0.711323105,2.12636,2009-Nov-04,DVN
Okay Fair enough And then second question just in terms of the comp obviously in {DATE} was a little bit softer than we expected and I understand all the drivers of that But how do you think it did from a share perspective a competitive market share perspective,4,48,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.020833333333333332,2.027055847,28.81,29490.51,4,0.711323105,2.12636,2009-Nov-04,DVN
Hey Good {TIME} Just a couple quick questions maybe out of the weeds here a little bit You had at {DATE} {CARDINAL} plants left kind of on the contracting side after the expiration of the DWR contracts and I 'm wondering how those plants are looking and whether you had finalized kind of marketing those for {DATE},4,57,1,0.0,0.017543859649122806,0.017543859649122806,0.017543859649122806,0.017543859649122806,4.501656563,28.81,8473.03956,11,1.877821197,1.18409,2009-Nov-04,HIG
Couple follow ups one is on the special dividend question that was asked earlier I guess the reason why what I am wondering is if you were if you decided not to do your approved buyback {DATE} based on what the stock is doing then why would n't you do a special dividend {DATE} to absorb what you were approved for in buybacks,2,63,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.015873015873015872,4.501656563,28.81,8473.03956,11,1.877821197,1.18409,2009-Nov-04,HIG
As a follow up can you talk a little bit about how much of your perm business is now technology related and what the future prospects are in that,1,29,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.7011212759999998,27.72,4481.480720000001,6,0.269237962,5.31548,2009-Nov-05,MCHP
I think in RBIS you mentioned that mass market was weak in {DATE} Was there any strength any particular strength in any of the other end market channels that is noteworthy,2,31,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06451612903225806,0.03225806451612903,2.1772391580000003,27.72,3841.5104,11,0.984862344,0.32543,2009-Nov-05,NDAQ

Okay I get it But just end up Jimmy because as you said you wo n't be filing rate cases {DATE} on the non I guess {DATE} where you get a rate case decision earnings should be much higher and then they levelize because you are not filing any increases for {DATE} right So there will be like bumps in earnings and I know you 're going to offset it somewhat with the share increase coming in but one can assume that earnings should be increasing in a more percentage basis in {DATE} where there is a rate increase is that fair to assume,3,104,1,0.0,0.009615384615384616,0.028846153846153848,0.0,0.0,3.061313477,27.72,1801.33507,6,0.482996023,5.90097,2009-Nov-05,SWKS

Hi guys Just to follow up again on the M&A piece Professional is still the number {CARDINAL} priority in terms of acquisitions You do n't have that much more interest in some of these OTC properties that are coming on the market or the healthcare business for Kimberly or anything like that It 's still these kind of smaller roll up plays in professional is that a fair assessment,5,69,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0200461130000003,27.72,4987.354,6,0.301807583,5.13323,2009-Nov-05,TDC
Do you see given that and given otherwise that the comp will be smaller dollars relatively to anything else you guys have gone through is there an opportunity here to settle this and just get it off the plate,1,39,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02564102564102564,0.0,1.251079151,27.72,9865.4094,7,1.465791939,4.84964,2009-Nov-05,CTL
Great And maybe just Didier quickly on the cash flow I know some of the moving parts for {DATE} But can you just remind us some of the key headwinds of why this is sort of a sub par year on cash flow versus what we would be used to given the sort of top line profit results,3,58,1,0.0,0.017241379310344827,0.017241379310344827,0.017241379310344827,0.0,2.341869052,27.72,3696.2615200000014,11,0.30165209600000004,2.33459,2009-Nov-05,FRT
Do you think if you got approval to invest this money at SC&E particularly in the filing here {DATE} could you carry lessons learned so to speak from SCE investments there storage EV et cetera to Edison Energy investments outside of California Is that a potential business model thinking that you could take lessons learned Or are we thinking about Edison Energy as completely separate type of investment,3,68,1,0.0,0.029411764705882353,0.029411764705882353,0.0,0.0,1.235180862,25.43,10484.59798,8,1.466118272,0.92714,2009-Nov-06,EIX
Yes understood And then also {CARDINAL} last one related to lender placed and then I have {CARDINAL} on solutions You mentioned a couple of smaller loan portfolios that came on board that maybe is masking the placement rate underlying falling Can you give us a sense for how much Can you do that math Do you have the data to be able to do the math on how much the placement rate would have fallen had you not had a few portfolios come on board,8,85,1,0.0,0.011764705882352941,0.011764705882352941,0.011764705882352941,0.0,1.235180862,25.43,10484.59798,8,1.466118272,0.92714,2009-Nov-06,EIX
Thanks for the question A question on Kyprolis I understand that Kyprolis has a greater path of improvement versus but some physicians commented the mix of different degrees overlaps the patient population makes it difficult to compare cross study data So now with elotusumab entering the market we 're in {DATE} can you share with us what you are hearing as to how physicians who utilize Kyprolis versus elotuzumab in the relapsed setting,4,73,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0273972602739726,0.0410958904109589,1.922144629,24.19,6149.57724,6,0.21746241,2.20656,2009-Nov-09,ROK
Okay you can follow up Then Frank on the realignment Spending {MONEY} and getting {MONEY} benefits is pretty huge It 's a hard number to fathom on {MONEY} of spend I guess it begs the question why would n't you have done it sooner if the returns are this strong,5,50,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02,0.02,1.922144629,24.19,6149.57724,6,0.21746241,2.20656,2009-Nov-09,ROK
Hi good {TIME} On NASDAQ Private Market are there metrics that you 're seeing that show that the {CARDINAL} companies that are signed up are utilizing the services offered So either metrics on secondary transactions or capital raise or something on access to liquidity And then what are the next steps for NPM,4,53,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.018867924528301886,0.0,1.009569614,24.19,12450.9035,8,0.8649459829999999,1.4155799999999998,2009-Nov-09,SRE
I appreciate that thanks Mike The spirit of the question was really given that you do n't really have an order early order program on tractors it seems like these lead times are extraordinarily long and they 're happening a lot quicker than usual Is that a fair assessment,4,49,1,0.0,0.0,0.02040816326530612,0.0,0.02040816326530612,1.009569614,24.19,12450.9035,8,0.8649459829999999,1.4155799999999998,2009-Nov-09,SRE
You know in electronics you saw some weakness and it seems that you 're expressing more of a longer downturn in the electronics given your headcount reduction in that segment And that outlook seems a bit different from several other companies that have reported so far So can you discuss why you 're sort of more negative in electronics and recovery there,3,62,1,0.0,0.0,0.03225806451612903,0.0,0.04838709677419355,1.948039699,24.19,3899.36412,10,0.813468062,1.20266,2009-Nov-09,HOLX
Hi good {TIME} You talked about how your same store numbers do n't include your redevelopments I 'm just wondering At this point right now it seems like you have a very large share of some of your top centers in redevelopment Is that a drag having that excluded given the strength of some of those,5,56,1,0.0,0.0,0.017857142857142856,0.03571428571428571,0.017857142857142856,2.212304514,24.19,8165.871,12,0.327884243,0.21613,2009-Nov-09,FLR
Great And then on your Money Transfer business obviously a drag to growth and a drag to the overall Firm 's margin and profitability Is there any inflection point that you see on the horizon It sounds like you 're going to anniversary some pricing changes And has the underperformance and greater cyclicality of this business brought you to think about more strategic options for this business going forward Or are you still fairly committed to the Money Transfer segment,6,80,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0375,0.0375,2.40135542,23.04,5434.17119,9,0.403288923,1.50812,2009-Nov-12,URBN

And then just lastly can you give us an update on Portal any change there and any other initiatives Is there any way that we can monitor the progress of those or any impact that we would see and I 'm assuming that would be in {DATE} at some point,3,50,1,0.0,0.0,0.02,0.02,0.0,2.74641101,23.04,7556.114159999999,9,0.442667919,0.24487,2009-Nov-12,JWN
Secondly Pullmantur You 've added {CARDINAL} vessels any {CARDINAL} of which is greater than the capacity which you yanked out Should we take this to mean that the Oceanic and {CARDINAL} of other vessels are likely to be out of the fleet within {DATE},2,44,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.022727272727272728,0.0,2.74641101,23.04,7556.114159999999,9,0.442667919,0.24487,2009-Nov-12,JWN
That seems a little more reasonable In terms of trends through the trends going forward obviously you 're talking about lowering your having to lower prices and I should assume that we should anticipate that your gross margin might move downward at probably the steeper trajectory as we had in {DATE} versus what we saw on a sequential basis in {DATE} I 'm not missing anything there am I,3,69,1,0.0,0.014492753623188406,0.07246376811594203,0.0,0.014492753623188406,1.63070007,22.89,37810.98911,9,0.603246013,2.17918,2009-Nov-17,TGT
Okay And then if we took the {MONEY} out are there factors then that are leading you to kind of come in below that,2,24,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041666666666666664,0.0,1.63070007,22.89,37810.98911,9,0.603246013,2.17918,2009-Nov-17,TGT
Okay Thanks Last question will just be on CAD I know in the news lately there 's been a little concern coming out of United on reimbursement changes there given what happened over in Portland {DATE} do you think it 's conceivable that UNH has taken a similar very limited cursory overview of that New England Journal study and have n't kicked the tires on the benefits of the technology and that maybe there 's a more in depth policy review that 's going on there,4,86,1,0.0,0.023255813953488372,0.023255813953488372,0.0,0.023255813953488372,3.0646114,22.63,3884.4505,12,0.623775314,3.62382,2009-Nov-20,DHI
Hi good {TIME} Just wanted to follow up quickly on your comments around spec and that you are pretty happy with how you reduced it so far Just curious I know this is a broad question but what you are kind of telling your sales force {DATE} I think at {DATE} you kind of implied you had given a lot of our sales force kind of the green light to move to specs What are you telling them now in terms of pricing and sort of what pace you want in the market,5,93,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.021505376344086023,0.03225806451612903,0.97767737,22.19,11785.3892,1,0.090667453,2.6221,2009-Nov-23,CPB

Okay That is good to hear And I guess just switching gears for a second on the marquee business the marquee business has grown noticeably in the US I think in the past you have talked about being {PERCENT} or so of the US footwear business and it seems like based on what you are talking about you expect that to continue to grow Is that in particular I guess with Nike and when you look at footwear pricing are the increases in pricing is it across the board or is it in strictly just the marquee end of the business,5,101,1,0.0,0.0,0.009900990099009901,0.009900990099009901,0.0,0.786042912,21.16,5219.50468,1,0.43595216,2.15544,2009-Nov-24,HRL
Thanks John Following that up when you guys survey your customer base are you seeing rising credit issues out there the counterparty risks or how do you size that up I know it is all over the place in tears of your diverse customer base but can you size that up for us,3,53,1,0.0,0.0,0.018867924528301886,0.0,0.0,0.786042912,21.16,5219.50468,1,0.43595216,2.15544,2009-Nov-24,HRL
Okay and just on the free cash flow piece,1,9,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.763597642,21.16,4333.6642,9,0.323253842,7.0137100000000006,2009-Nov-24,DLTR
You got right in the wheel house Right But on the you are good for {DATE} regardless of what happens with that third ship,3,24,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041666666666666664,0.0,1.302736012,24.51,16881.27804,9,0.487799094,0.82216,2009-Dec-01,SPLS
So close to {QUANTITY} as a trend if I look at the historical {CARDINAL} to {CARDINAL} And so for {DATE} as a starting point would {CARDINAL} or {CARDINAL} or what might be a reasonable range do you think to understanding that you 're going to be flexible given market conditions but given what you see {DATE} what might be a reasonable range to guesstimate,3,64,1,0.0,0.03125,0.03125,0.0,0.0,1.670357144,22.1,14871.237,9,0.38075672,3.6606,2009-Dec-08,KR
And does that mean Alan that maybe the same project {DATE} would be I do n't know {PERCENT} more expensive that it is {DATE} or something like that And that 's the difference in your new awards now versus {DATE},2,40,1,0.0,0.025,0.025,0.0,0.0,1.426063196,20.54,11383.533,12,0.137221552,2.20823,2009-Dec-17,PAYX
Okay great And I notice there was a big sequential uptick in other operating expenses I think presumably some of that is increased ad spend from the marketing of the Bags Fly Free campaign Can you maybe tell me if that 's correct or incorrect and maybe quantify it for me the incremental ad spend,4,55,1,0.0,0.03636363636363636,0.05454545454545454,0.01818181818181818,0.01818181818181818,1.426063196,20.54,11383.533,12,0.137221552,2.20823,2009-Dec-17,PAYX
Is it fair to assume that that carries a much better gross margin structure relative to the high end of your {PERCENT},1,22,1,0.0,0.0,0.045454545454545456,0.045454545454545456,0.0,1.306594034,20.54,115859.4064,6,0.260790766,5.62154,2009-Dec-17,ORCL
A couple of questions for you With regard to your free cash flow objective of {MONEY} for {DATE} you 're ahead of your inventory reduction objectives in {DATE} With that in mind can you speak to how you would get to that {MONEY} cash flow objective with the various components you 'd CR Is there further inventory reduction opportunity you see in {DATE},4,63,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.015873015873015872,0.015873015873015872,1.306594034,20.54,115859.4064,6,0.260790766,5.62154,2009-Dec-17,ORCL

Hi Good {TIME} everyone Bob on the US options business I know your goal has been to maximize profit and not necessarily market share Market share is growing but looking back it looks like the net revenue capture is tracking down {PERCENT} from {DATE} levels Do you think you 've achieve that right balance And maybe if not what needs to change for you to get that balance right,7,69,1,0.0,0.014492753623188406,0.014492753623188406,0.028985507246376812,0.0,2.399574455,22.51,4840.28696,9,0.766525336,3.8978,2009-Dec-18,KMX

Yes thank you Peter or Tim I would like to follow up on your comment that you 're actively discussing uses of cash Is that any different quite frankly than what you 've been doing historically Or is that statement meant to suggest that you 're thinking more constructively about cash than have you historically,4,55,1,0.0,0.01818181818181818,0.01818181818181818,0.01818181818181818,0.0,2.144008539,22.51,20825.61384,12,0.874140785,1.52059,2009-Dec-18,CCL

Okay Then last thing if I can Clarence the {PERCENT} pricing ex coal so ex export coal we have n't gotten that level of breakout before Can you give us just a sense on how that {PERCENT} compares with what it would 've looked like {DATE} or {DATE} I 'm just trying to get a sense if the pricing ex coal if that environment is changing now that we are through the legacy contracts Is this kind of the new normal,5,81,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.531392124,17.85,115762.08,6,0.375071448,3.82429,2010-Jan-14,INTC
Frank going back to the regions how they 're doing now what are you seeing in {DATE} I assume you 're not anticipating CAMECA shipping all these systems for {DATE} Maybe you are Is Europe going to be kind of trend down to where everybody else is having Europe right now kind of flat to down but US you think is going to pick up,4,65,1,0.0,0.015384615384615385,0.046153846153846156,0.0,0.0,1.842959185,17.63,183449.5005,11,0.957090161,1.68157,2010-Jan-15,JPM
James just the last thing on that point you just made a little bit ago about where loans are coming on versus where they 're coming off Can you give us an update of where the floors are how much of the book still has floors against it and how much of that is that the burden of the higher versus lower,2,62,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03225806451612903,1.842959185,17.63,183449.5005,11,0.957090161,1.68157,2010-Jan-15,JPM
Okay and any thoughts on when that may occur or how serious you are about doing that,1,17,1,0.0,0.058823529411764705,0.058823529411764705,0.0,0.058823529411764705,2.389088007,17.58,141172.439,11,1.4909957180000002,0.69205,2010-Jan-20,BAC
So you think about the back {DATE} you obviously get a {DATE} boost in {DATE} Is that the principal reason why you 're optimistic you 'll return to growth or are there any other things going on that should help that through the balance of {DATE},2,46,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043478260869565216,0.0,1.95843239,17.58,35561.32532,11,0.857735418,1.41417,2010-Jan-20,BK
Speaking of that should we expect obviously {DATE} you had a low combined return of capital number as a percentage of your earnings relative to some of your peers that went through CCAR with you Should we expect this {DATE} 's number in {DATE} to be greater than what you guys asked for {DATE},2,54,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.018518518518518517,0.0,1.95843239,17.58,35561.32532,11,0.857735418,1.41417,2010-Jan-20,BK

Okay And then on China just to clarify on that as well it sounds like you are optimistic that you have a recovery but it does sound like that will be it sounds like that will be more US centric than I would have expected {DATE} though If I think about the moving pieces meaning the US looks a little stronger than it was an China Looks like it 's going to be back end loaded Is that a fair way to look at it,6,85,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.023529411764705882,0.0,1.95843239,17.58,35561.32532,11,0.857735418,1.41417,2010-Jan-20,BK

Okay Thanks for that Then just a quick follow up on the pricing I just want to make sure I heard correctly I think you said spine pricing net of mix was down {PERCENT} Is that right Then {CARDINAL} is there anything specific that you saw in {DATE} on the spine pricing contracts coming up or a big contract coming up,6,61,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.710394812,17.58,12671.2824,11,0.498427357,3.26684,2010-Jan-20,NTRS
Just a couple of questions on concessions and leasing commissions in {DATE} They bumped up Is that really a function of the mix or is there {CARDINAL} specific lease that you might have done that was a driver of those numbers,3,41,1,0.0,0.024390243902439025,0.024390243902439025,0.0,0.024390243902439025,2.184741725,17.58,144590.8324,11,0.7390727290000001,1.30552,2010-Jan-20,WFC

Okay thanks And then second question on Distech just {CARDINAL} separate questions that are somewhat intertwined I know you have n't enclosed the deal but do you envision that you will have to make meaningful investment in educating the agent and distribution partner network that you have as well as the acquisitions other partners in terms of their distribution in terms of educating them on the holistic offering that you guys will be able to deliver going forward How does that end up working from an investment standpoint Then second with the meaningful presence in Europe does this potentially give you a platform to expand your business a lot more meaningfully looking out {CARDINAL} {DATE} {DATE} in the European market,5,120,1,0.0,0.008333333333333333,0.008333333333333333,0.008333333333333333,0.016666666666666666,1.760112528,18.68,7563.0177,6,0.218291337,1.1726,2010-Jan-21,APH

Well great that 's great to hear And then I guess secondly the growth the flat to {PERCENT} is there anything in {DATE} that would be different or any comp issues that would n't allow that same type of growth to continue into {DATE} and maybe even get a little better because I think some of the comp issues get a little easier even into {DATE},2,66,1,0.0,0.015151515151515152,0.015151515151515152,0.06060606060606061,0.0,3.067001885,18.68,8990.49996,11,1.275556111,1.45592,2010-Jan-21,FITB

Great And second question I wanted to us was follow up on what Carl was talking about earlier Your portfolio of markets is still I think The you have talked about how you are reducing the number of divisions from which you are managing those regions which is going to create some distance and I 'm thinking of a market like the Triad market perhaps which a lot of people have tried to manage out of a Raleigh or Charlotte Have you seen any issues or difficulties in managing all of these locations more remotely now that you have consolidated your divisions,5,102,1,0.0,0.00980392156862745,0.00980392156862745,0.00980392156862745,0.0196078431372549,2.086710114,18.68,9975.49584,6,0.535345912,12.94194,2010-Jan-21,WDC

Great And then Larry you talked about the new stores now I guess {CARDINAL} went to {CARDINAL} You have had mentioned opportunities perhaps as stores become available post holiday Does that suggest that you have the opportunity perhaps Mervyn 's presents an example going back {CARDINAL} if that situation presents itself,5,51,1,0.0,0.058823529411764705,0.058823529411764705,0.058823529411764705,0.0,1.89568831,22.27,82024.18884,4,0.245813489,1.27931,2010-Jan-22,SLB

My name has been a controversial topic on these calls {DATE} but you get some interesting stuff going on here Bob It requires I think a little bit in the weeds on some of this but on BX we know you 've been picking up market share There 's been a high rebate relative to the spread in stocks like Sirius and I guess what do you expect going forward I know there 's been some issue on whether that pricing level can be maintained and Sirius actually moved up above a buck so any comments there on the outlook on revenue excuse me rebate versus the spreads on these low price stocked at BX,5,115,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.008695652173913044,1.0650568,22.27,5720.1,11,0.910104701,0.14564000000000002,2010-Jan-22,PBCT

The last thing is you are using pricing to win business and share Is it more with getting actually new customers or is it more expanding into new lines with existing customers and kind of getting to sometimes in this industry to win customers and then margins kind of normalized,2,50,1,0.0,0.02,0.02,0.04,0.0,1.160026302,22.27,25383.81069,3,0.21767549100000005,3.57766,2010-Jan-22,KMB

First question I want to go to the comments you made right at the beginning of the call Don in terms of increasing investment trying to take share looking at potential new submarkets and I think you also said expanding the move up buyer segment Looking at those statements as a whole is that something that we should take to expect an acceleration in community count growth in {DATE},3,69,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.014492753623188406,1.425839965,22.27,16906.84116,5,0.314212394,1.16595,2010-Jan-22,APD

Thanks good {TIME} everybody If I could just follow up on Greg on that last comment you made and appreciate the additional detail Is that {CARDINAL} times EBITDA and I guess this is really more for Prism the {MONEY} of targeted income is the confidence in that coming from the level of synergies that you see that you can take out Or is it more coming or equally coming from an ongoing expected activity ramp drilling ramp in the area,4,80,1,0.0,0.0125,0.0125,0.0125,0.0,3.890622248,27.31,2656.5055,11,2.170972264,1.35707,2010-Jan-25,ZION

Hi good {TIME} everybody {DATE} So I was hoping we could dig into the gross margin the FIFO gross margin a little bit {DATE} It was a little bit lighter than what I thought it was going to be And I think if you were to look at it and remove the generic benefit my guess and this is where I 'm hoping you can help but my guess is the selling gross margin {DATE} is probably weaker than what we 've seen otherwise {DATE} Could you maybe just give us some more detail on selling what 's going on the shrink side maybe the non selling side and how this how the margin played out versus what you were expecting,6,121,1,0.0,0.03305785123966942,0.04132231404958678,0.01652892561983471,0.008264462809917356,1.796771539,27.31,179318.7113,6,0.202999127,11.9305,2010-Jan-25,AAPL
Okay that 's helpful thank you And then I guess question on the cost side Why more focus on reducing OEC not available {DATE} than in the past And then the second part of that what kind of benefits do you expect to see from the greater focus,4,48,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.020833333333333332,0.020833333333333332,1.796771539,27.31,179318.7113,6,0.202999127,11.9305,2010-Jan-25,AAPL
Okay Then on that point as we start to renegotiate utility contracts the rail industry generally has been very disciplined on price there Do we feel like these next round of negotiations given where natural prices are given the concerns longer term on regulation and whatnot do the utilities have a lot more leverage here such that we need to be thinking about there may have to be some give backs if you will so to speak on price i.e. not as much upside left there,3,86,1,0.0,0.011627906976744186,0.011627906976744186,0.0,0.023255813953488372,1.796771539,27.31,179318.7113,6,0.202999127,11.9305,2010-Jan-25,AAPL

Right okay That 's helpful And then lastly you probably would want to buy chloride based from China if more chloride based capacity could come on Do you find that you 're able to do that There 's some new chloride plants in China that I think has begun to ship commercially Are those plants you can avail yourself of,6,60,1,0.0,0.016666666666666666,0.03333333333333333,0.016666666666666666,0.0,1.016357565,25.41,6678.05172,9,0.188859708,4.09863,2010-Jan-26,SHW
Most of my questions have been answered But just following up on what Sean has said about the face of share repurchases and the fact that you were perhaps not as aggressive in {DATE} looking out to your M&A pipeline obviously nothing was announced in {DATE} So is there something that we should look over to in {DATE} Or did I misinterpret your comments about M&A playing a role in your share repurchase decisions,4,74,1,0.0,0.013513513513513514,0.013513513513513514,0.0,0.02702702702702703,2.771397735,25.41,4969.7001,12,0.476421415,0.12291,2010-Jan-26,JEC

Ron I 'm wondering if you could just bridge the margin performance for us in {DATE} over year sequentially at the gross margin line Any specific significant items that you 'll highlighted pricing versus cost Any other factors that you could just maybe help us understand the pretty significant expansion on {DATE} and sequentially,3,54,1,0.0,0.05555555555555555,0.05555555555555555,0.0,0.018518518518518517,2.771397735,25.41,4969.7001,12,0.476421415,0.12291,2010-Jan-26,JEC
Okay Great Thanks Can you give us some color on how we should think about margin trends for your enterprise SSD business relative to the enterprise HDD business I know you do n't give the absolute levels but if you could just give us some color on how we should think about the trends relative particularly now that it 's becoming a much more significant part of the overall business,5,70,1,0.0,0.014285714285714285,0.014285714285714285,0.014285714285714285,0.0,1.886144619,25.41,3346.32,5,0.386738731,2.53487,2010-Jan-26,ALB
I want to go back on the discussion for potentially getting some dividend out of the bank to the hold co and the regulatory approval process you guys are going through Paul one of the things you mentioned is de risking the bank You guys are selling {MONEY} of credit card loans Is that something that we should think about as a more of a viable option for you guys in the current environment where real estate prices are maybe a little bit better maybe there is a little bit more of a bid for riskier assets for you to I guess de risk the bank more aggressively by actually selling either the first leans or the home equity loans,4,120,1,0.0,0.016666666666666666,0.041666666666666664,0.008333333333333333,0.008333333333333333,3.28594175,25.41,10391.02826,12,0.214315949,0.7098300000000001,2010-Jan-26,DAL

Great Appreciate that {CARDINAL} last one just in the DJ With respect to the production you 're seeing on each one of the intervals either Niobrara A B and C or Codell how are those type curves bearing or are they maintaining consistency across the board Is there {CARDINAL} area that 's better than another area that you might target instead in {DATE} to enhance capital efficiency Anything you can comment on that side would be great,6,77,1,0.0,0.012987012987012988,0.012987012987012988,0.06493506493506493,0.0,1.77873377,25.41,29130.079680000006,3,0.518700045,0.72359,2010-Jan-26,GLW
Okay Thanks And then just last on the G&A you kind of suggested there 's a slightly different maybe seasonality {DATE} with {DATE} being a little bit lower with more investments maybe {DATE} maybe if you could just talk about what some of those moving pieces were and then just related to that how we should think about the seasonality maybe going forward Is this {DATE} kind of the way we should think about it when we are modeling {DATE},5,80,1,0.0,0.0625,0.075,0.0,0.0,1.77873377,25.41,29130.079680000006,3,0.518700045,0.72359,2010-Jan-26,GLW
Okay thanks Maybe if I could just follow up on capital deployment George you said all along that your preference is clearly to do strategic M&A versus share repurchase But here we are halfway through {DATE} and you have already blown through your share repurchase target Should we read into that that maybe you do n't see anything on the strategic M&A front that interests you Or maybe can you just give us an update there on how we should think about capital deployment for the balance of {DATE} given where the leverage sits on the balance sheet,6,98,1,0.01020408163265306,0.04081632653061224,0.04081632653061224,0.0,0.0,1.294645518,24.55,64193.29532999999,3,0.308616236,0.37654,2010-Jan-27,UTX
Just a couple of questions if I may Greg I certainly recognize that the oldest Checker stores that were converted earliest are still performing the best but of the various steps in the conversion process between implementing the computer systems and putting the hard parts in the stores and the planograms and the resets what all of which are at various stages of course together with the exterior signage what in your opinion drives the greatest incremental benefits once each of those conversion processes are added to the stores,2,89,1,0.011235955056179775,0.011235955056179775,0.011235955056179775,0.02247191011235955,0.011235955056179775,2.202221264,24.55,8977.89368,11,0.477311216,3.5355300000000005,2010-Jan-27,BXP

Okay How soon would any type of implementation is this going to be implemented after the fact so you would benefit in a {CARDINAL} scenario Is there any way to know how immediate these actions can take place,3,38,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02631578947368421,0.0,1.305021827,23.14,8447.280840000001,3,0.163770506,1.00155,2010-Jan-28,COL
{CARDINAL} last real quick {CARDINAL} If you 're going to experience a {PERCENT} increase in your revenue per fab opportunity at {CARDINAL} nanometers versus {CARDINAL} blended between logic and memory when would you start to see outperformance in your orders relative to the industry Is that happening now relative to this opportunity or when we see a concerted upswing in capacity expansion are you going to see your orders shoot out faster than the industry,4,75,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02666666666666667,0.0,1.197377219,23.14,4747.49635,3,0.338316429,3.22079,2010-Jan-28,BLL
Okay As we think about EBITA growth or EBIT growth for Vegas just trying to figure out if margins moved higher in {DATE} so if admissions were up slightly was EBITDA up slightly as well,2,35,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.197377219,23.14,4747.49635,3,0.338316429,3.22079,2010-Jan-28,BLL
Okay and then so last one I had was relative to the EBIT growth The adjustments you 've made to your guidance seem to reflect the foreign exchange the obvious foreign exchange hit but foodservice and the international division did come in weaker than I expected and it looks like those conditions could be persisting throughout {DATE} so are there no adjustments to your EBIT growth for the reality of those {CARDINAL} divisions or something to make up for that,2,80,1,0.0,0.0125,0.0125,0.0,0.025,0.983334315,23.14,23832.42465,6,0.479206147,0.7064,2010-Jan-28,DHR
Good {TIME} this is Nils Wallin sitting in for Mark Just had a question with regard to your pipeline {DATE} it seems you had {CARDINAL} major families move forward in phase and how would you characterize the rate of acceleration in your pipeline Is it improving or is it simply that we 've seen all of the R&D efforts hit critical mass in {DATE},4,64,1,0.0,0.0,0.015625,0.03125,0.03125,0.983334315,23.14,23832.42465,6,0.479206147,0.7064,2010-Jan-28,DHR
Do you have an estimate as to how much the delivering activities of {DATE} and sort of the negative spread and cost to carry on the cash that you are holding on your balance sheet has on {CARDINAL} guidance Do you know how much that affected the numbers,2,48,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.020833333333333332,0.995488296,23.14,20486.78082,6,0.505921906,1.80702,2010-Jan-28,RTN
Okay Great Secondly this sort of goes hand in hand with Ed Najarian 's question I 'm not sure you 'll be able to answer it but I need to ask it anyway This issue of the agreement on the back stops and whether or not there will be some price to be paid for a non existent agreement can you tell us when you expect or what your best expectation right now is when that issue gets resolved,6,79,1,0.012658227848101266,0.0,0.0,0.0379746835443038,0.02531645569620253,1.879130475,23.14,9903.64284,4,0.807534595,0.016319999999999998,2010-Jan-28,MUR
Then kind of how can we figure out on a forward looking basis without checking in with you every so often whether the economics of switching is in Duke 's favor or not Meaning can track on based on gas prices can we track it based on GDP I mean is there someway we can track it or figure out how the economics work,4,64,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.195611848,23.14,260219.5779,6,0.186820675,3.65808,2010-Jan-28,MSFT

Okay And then Phil the prospect pipeline it sounds like it 's relatively healthy How about some of the big large deals that you were working on Obviously probably the biggest BofA was signed but are there still others out there that you see in the prospect pipeline,4,48,1,0.0,0.0,0.020833333333333332,0.0,0.0,1.3758274119999998,23.14,29168.56062,3,0.146946066,3.0428,2010-Jan-28,LMT
Thanks guys Just wanted to build a little bit on the last question here So with pricing kind of running at the lower end of the range as you guys said and when you roll that into revenue growth you 're running I guess {PERCENT} so far {DATE} I understand will accelerate to maybe {PERCENT} or so You guys had talked about kind of a mid single digit guidance for the {DATE} {DATE} {DATE} Is that something you still are very comfortable you can attain and how much improvement do you need in terms of new business creation to actually get there,7,102,1,0.0,0.00980392156862745,0.00980392156862745,0.0196078431372549,0.00980392156862745,1.724133756,23.14,5612.49753,8,0.554822855,2.4986200000000003,2010-Jan-28,EQT

And then last one just trying to think about maybe the potential to avoid some of the really big distraction that we saw {DATE} around what is sort of becoming an annual event at the shareholder vote Have you guys considered maybe articulating some kind of plan or a blue print or a map or what have you to get people comfortable with the future state of CEO Chairman roles way down the line when there is sort of a succession that is in place,2,85,1,0.0,0.023529411764705882,0.023529411764705882,0.0,0.011764705882352941,1.490670119,23.73,7916.246040000001,3,0.562757513,2.30423,2010-Jan-29,DOV
Okay That 's helpful And then this other question for you Rob on the balance sheet You mentioned that we are going to need to reauthorize share repurchase {DATE} As I look you guys are at about a full turn less of leverage than most of the other rails and your returns are better than average for sure Do you think that there 's an opportunity now that we 're through legacy and we need some other parts to the story is there an opportunity to more aggressively take on some leverage and more aggressively buy back stock,7,98,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.030612244897959183,0.01020408163265306,1.11134786,23.73,146939.0683,4,0.669159459,2.04026,2010-Jan-29,CVX
What 's your sense just on the regulatory expenses {DATE} Clearly you had some up tick in expenses in {DATE} due to CCAR et cetera Do you feel like that 's going to be a meaningful contributor to expense reduction in {DATE},3,42,1,0.023809523809523808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.6863295390000002,23.73,3943.34,3,0.426641418,0.41463,2010-Jan-29,NWL

I risk a rules violation here but since you mentioned it {CARDINAL} more question on that topic Australia is there still a still a surcharging headwind there or has that abated in some way To thinking about the small ticket transactions I 've seen that {PERCENT} potentially {PERCENT} of retailers potentially surcharge in Australia Is that down,4,57,1,0.0,0.0,0.017543859649122806,0.0,0.03508771929824561,1.556273045,23.73,12823.40293,2,0.429178906,1.69667,2010-Jan-29,PCAR
Okay Rob let me ask you {CARDINAL} last question too then here On share buybacks how opportunistic can you be or is {DATE} run rate what we should expect Can you if the shares are down a fair amount can you ramp this up or do you feel like no we would rather have it be a consistent buyback {DATE},4,60,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03333333333333333,1.556273045,23.73,12823.40293,2,0.429178906,1.69667,2010-Jan-29,PCAR
{CARDINAL} quick last one The Asia margins I think you referred to continued expectations for continued healthy margins in the back {CARDINAL} and you 've already done pretty well in {DATE} Does that imply margins in the back half similar to the first {CARDINAL} or should it drift higher perhaps with the acceleration of integration benefits,3,56,1,0.0,0.017857142857142856,0.017857142857142856,0.0,0.0,1.146605265,24.62,16565.57361,9,0.299769572,2.17732,2010-Feb-01,SYY
Okay And do you anticipate maybe an acceleration in that effort As you look at foreign nameplates becoming a greater percentage of that {DATE} plus population how might your buying patterns change a little bit or do you anticipate any changes in your approach to either DIY or the DIY femme side of the business,3,55,1,0.0,0.03636363636363636,0.07272727272727272,0.01818181818181818,0.0,1.146605265,24.62,16565.57361,9,0.299769572,2.17732,2010-Feb-01,SYY
Okay I guess one final question As you start to accumulate cash it does n't sound like you 're going to be particularly aggressive in your buyback strategies I guess do you pay down debt or is there the potential for a larger M&A move on the horizon,4,48,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.020833333333333332,1.808238487,24.62,3896.92116,10,0.813468062,1.83808,2010-Feb-01,HOLX
Obviously Protiviti has a real shine here and I was wondering how you couch Protiviti within your guidance The things that drove the incremental revenue in {DATE} are those that type of drivers that could drive sequential growth for Protiviti in {DATE} given that your overall guidance is calling for flat to down revenues sequentially,2,55,1,0.0,0.01818181818181818,0.01818181818181818,0.0,0.0,1.808238487,24.62,3896.92116,10,0.813468062,1.83808,2010-Feb-01,HOLX
What does that say about the existing utilization rates of your existing installed base or your customers existing mail production equipment and mail meter equipment Is there significant excess capacity within your customer base,2,34,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.6126301980000002,22.59,4250.70381,6,0.15631145,4.80232,2010-Feb-02,VRSN
Can I try to pin you down on {CARDINAL} other thing On HD obviously I had people calling me about the Master 's and look at the Dogwood tree you can see every blossom on it How much did that as far as revenues did that add {MONEY} {MONEY} You can give us a little more specifics on how much that might have added to {DATE},4,66,1,0.0,0.015151515151515152,0.015151515151515152,0.0,0.0,0.922888846,22.59,5743.83743,8,0.7934906340000001,1.46339,2010-Feb-02,WEC
So there was great color on some of the innovation that 's happening right now in the product lines Can you talk about any visibility you have looking out into {DATE} or {DATE} Are your consumer teams available to identify new problems that you think you can solve and become new big platforms to drive growth once you get out into those out {DATE},3,64,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03125,0.015625,0.922888846,22.59,5743.83743,8,0.7934906340000001,1.46339,2010-Feb-02,WEC
Just I was wondering if there were any other projects along the pipeline area aside from the next one that you have been talking about for a while,1,28,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.922888846,22.59,5743.83743,8,0.7934906340000001,1.46339,2010-Feb-02,WEC
Are margins headed back towards the teens though in that region given all this mix of factors,1,17,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.147666681,22.59,9591.4252,12,0.110040433,2.67652,2010-Feb-02,CHRW
How much of that gross margin improvement is kind of less promotional environment or is it versus kind of a sourcing opportunity,1,22,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09090909090909091,0.0,3.098815659,22.59,3783.69981,12,0.623775314,2.49928,2010-Feb-02,DHI
Okay And then historically your company has been generally unwilling to do large and medium sized acquisitions There are decent medium sized acquisition out there in the states right now Do you have any interest in going out of your comfort zone with these smaller acquisitions,4,46,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.021739130434782608,3.098815659,22.59,3783.69981,12,0.623775314,2.49928,2010-Feb-02,DHI
Thanks Just a couple of questions on yield please Just on the {DATE} yields which are down {PERCENT} your guidance for states it was down {PERCENT} to down {PERCENT} And normally at that stage you sold pretty well most of {DATE} you 're in {PERCENT} or so So mathematically that would imply the prices for the bookings that have n't been sold yet must have been up pretty substantially {PERCENT} or so if my math is correct Were you surprised by that {TIME} strength or were you just conservative in your guidance or is my math wrong,6,97,1,0.010309278350515464,0.0,0.0,0.010309278350515464,0.020618556701030927,1.885924368,21.48,33575.00949,7,1.494368126,3.06642,2010-Feb-03,CMCSA
Just back on the Combat Systems can you just talk a little bit about it sounds like the mix in terms of the development and engineering which helps you {DATE} should I be thinking about as we go into {DATE} that that 's going to put some pressure on margins And then your number for {DATE} implies something on the order of {MONEY} in {DATE} I know European land systems helps but does that imply something closer to a double digit type of growth rate {DATE} from the lower base {DATE} as things start to move in,3,97,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.448261974,21.48,155257.8726,10,0.734311443,0.8590700000000001,2010-Feb-03,PFE
What is driving the improvement in product availability or quality and quantity Is it late shipments from China Is it the inventories have gotten a little bit not out of whack but a little bit higher than department stores What do you think the drivers are,4,46,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.021739130434782608,0.021739130434782608,2.707728356,21.6,499.86312,12,0.686209228,0.07087,2010-Feb-04,URI
Okay that 's very helpful I appreciate it And {CARDINAL} other one in terms of the seasonal decline in gross profit in {DATE} what normally causes that Is that weakness in wholesale prices in {DATE},4,35,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05714285714285714,1.132471879,21.6,16528.58868,9,0.066520618,1.23981,2010-Feb-04,YUM
And then I think I want to confirm something I think I heard is that if you look at the seasonality that you saw on the revenue lying here in {DATE} is probably a pretty normal {DATE} adjusting for distortions {DATE} Is that fair,2,44,1,0.0,0.0,0.022727272727272728,0.0,0.045454545454545456,1.086546441,21.6,4615.2732,12,0.217693307,0.58837,2010-Feb-04,SRCL
Okay And then as far as the deal environment I do n't know if I 'm reading too much into it but I think Alan had made some comments kind of about the deal outlook and being encouraged by it And historically as a company you guys have been some of the most cautious around Acute Care hospital acquisitions because you have a very specific target deal in mind I mean do you see that that pipeline is actually starting to heat up there or was I reading too much into that,4,92,1,0.0,0.0,0.010869565217391304,0.010869565217391304,0.0,1.086546441,21.6,4615.2732,12,0.217693307,0.58837,2010-Feb-04,SRCL
Separately in a little bit of a follow up on the LIBOR question so one of the concerns that people have had is that clearly with large London presence and with what had happened in the CIO there was a question around controls in that region And so it begs it gets to people thinking about gee if the CIO office did n't have the controls in that part of the world why should we believe that the rest of the organization did And so I think that 's what 's on people 's minds as they 're hearing today the CIO trade all boxed and wrapped up but looking forward {DATE} how do we know it 's not going to come up in some other areas,4,127,1,0.007874015748031496,0.0,0.007874015748031496,0.0,0.023622047244094488,2.98061332,21.6,4522.1666,6,0.235777496,0.6896399999999999,2010-Feb-04,ILMN
Thank you Just wanted to touch on I think you mentioned that the bill rate spreads in the US were strong Any color on what is going on on the European side,3,32,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03125,0.0,1.886996868,21.6,6337.93039,11,0.455627318,0.54192,2010-Feb-04,AVB
And then just a quick follow up on that I think when the original positioning around Creative Cloud was both the opportunity to migrate existing users to the cloud and also an opportunity to attract net new users And I think you laid out a goal of {CARDINAL} net new users over {DATE} Putting that against the framework of subscriptions tracking ahead of what you 'd expected maybe {DATE} or when you initially gave that guidance is the upside coming from more existing customers upgrading Or a better attraction outside of the core base And is that still the right trajectory to be thinking about in terms of the user base expansion opportunity,6,113,1,0.0,0.008849557522123894,0.008849557522123894,0.04424778761061947,0.008849557522123894,1.3933793630000002,21.6,3697.888,11,1.41131538,2.11963,2010-Feb-04,AIZ
Okay That 's great And the gross margin here what 's your outlook moving into {DATE} I know sometimes you 'll have adjustments to the accruals and in the context of the bill rate at least on a global basis flattening out Can you continue to expand that,5,48,1,0.0,0.020833333333333332,0.020833333333333332,0.020833333333333332,0.0,1.942786613,21.6,8938.78128,11,0.511637762,5.32673,2010-Feb-04,EQR

Thank you Good {TIME} Following up on the decision to increase the ATM and the buyback program to levels more appropriate for the size of your business are you potentially thinking about other parts of the business whether it 's the financial side or on operations that also need to increase given the larger scale you have,3,57,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.017543859649122806,0.0,1.151086095,26.08,10791.68616,8,0.627647197,3.75081,2010-Feb-05,PPL
Just a quick follow up on the CCAR You had mentioned the difference well you did n't say the exact difference between advanced and standardized but I wonder if you could shed light on the spread between the {CARDINAL} And I 'm just curious does it play a bigger role in the process {DATE} or you were just pointing it out,3,61,1,0.0,0.01639344262295082,0.01639344262295082,0.0,0.0,2.049006878,26.08,19845.4764,11,0.193761107,1.82781,2010-Feb-05,SPG
I think it was on this call maybe {DATE} where we were talking about payment terms with clients John maybe your quote was we are not a bank It 's interesting to see the good numbers in the context of that trend Then I just had {CARDINAL} more You 've talked a lot about the process to close the deal At this point I do n't know if you can give us a forecast Is it your expectation this transaction closes in {DATE},7,83,1,0.0,0.024096385542168676,0.024096385542168676,0.012048192771084338,0.0,2.451223226,26.08,1785.45052,11,0.312354397,2.4123900000000003,2010-Feb-05,AIV
Jim you mentioned in your remarks that your rate base numbers obviously exclude SONGS Once the Phase II decision comes out you will relook at those rate base numbers Would that also be a time for you to relook at your guidance for {DATE} you know depending on what you do with that SONGS rate base,3,56,1,0.0,0.017857142857142856,0.017857142857142856,0.0,0.0,2.201912028,26.08,12671.205,11,0.6959248290000001,0.79388,2010-Feb-05,AET
Thank you And can we talk about sort of the relationship between advertising expense and distribution strategy You guys spend {MONEY} a year on advertising which is a lot and I understand that because you need people to go to southwest.com to buy your tickets But have you thought about that in the context of maybe putting some more of your inventory on online travel agencies that would give you more exposure that way and maybe alleviate some of the expense on the advertising side that you would have to get in peoples minds to go to southwest.com If they just go to Expedia and see your fare there maybe you could spend a little bit less on advertising while sort of tweaking the distribution strategy a little bit Any thoughts on the relationship between those {CARDINAL},6,137,1,0.0,0.029197080291970802,0.0364963503649635,0.0,0.0,2.201912028,26.08,12671.205,11,0.6959248290000001,0.79388,2010-Feb-05,AET

{TIME} So Ron I think in {CARDINAL} of the earlier questions about margins you talked about the last cycle you got to really high build numbers and backlogs And I get the backlog 's not there but we 're ordering trucks on a run rate north of {CARDINAL} right now So why is n't this the time to get more price and do you think can PACCAR take a leadership role to start trying to push more pricing,5,78,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01282051282051282,0.01282051282051282,2.61248057,26.51,7101.371,11,1.495483313,2.08343,2010-Feb-09,LNC

The {PERCENT} year on year growth in assets under custody if we strip out the market performance from that is n't that kind of a sustainable pace of organic growth Or would you say that there are some lumpy wins in there and obviously the market performance is what it is but if you take that out are those is that basic growth on an underlying basis sustainable Or was it driven by lumpiness that would be difficult to maintain that,4,81,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.012345679012345678,0.779723754,21.72,5424.00111,1,0.43595216,3.53696,2010-Feb-18,HRL

My first question is on your comments on expenses Steve You did mention at the end of your prepared remarks that you continue to look for ways to reduce expenses I believe you gave us a core number {DATE} excluding litigation of something {MONEY} Correct me if I 'm wrong but as we think about your revenue strength is the better way to think about your expense levels from here and {DATE} really through a reduced efficiency ratio rather than just thinking about absolute levels of expenses,4,87,1,0.0,0.0,0.011494252873563218,0.034482758620689655,0.034482758620689655,2.05268007,21.72,13056.2807,8,0.984813225,2.5356,2010-Feb-18,WMB
You know some very nice margin improvement When you 're talking about discretionary cost controls and specifically the discretionary component should this kind of SG&A level be something we should think of as a sustainable run rate or is it really just at this level given the uncertainty and some of those cost controls are going to be lifted when hopefully things improve,2,63,1,0.0,0.0,0.015873015873015872,0.031746031746031744,0.0,1.094071342,20.63,3736.25609,8,1.296917932,1.28572,2010-Feb-19,PNW

I wanted to ask about your owned land position I wanted to get a sense of the kind of state of development of it So I guess {CARDINAL} ways of looking at that would be how many of your owned lots are fully developed and a second way of looking at it would be the dollar amount that it would take to bring your owned lot portfolio to a fully developed state,3,72,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.143676779,19.94,7359.087359999998,8,1.173266446,0.04813,2010-Feb-23,DTE
And then maybe drilling down a little bit on the gross margin line I think we were a little bit surprised to see it I mean basically flat we thought it might be down just given inflation and the way some of the math works on your contracted business where you have a fixed fee Can you talk about what 's going on there It is really just about making sure you pass through the inflation Or are there some productivity improvements within the gross margin line that are helping that stay flat,7,93,1,0.0,0.021505376344086023,0.021505376344086023,0.010752688172043012,0.0,1.143676779,19.94,7359.087359999998,8,1.173266446,0.04813,2010-Feb-23,DTE
And if I could just if I could follow up just in the prior periods it always had taken longer for the international markets to adjust to the changes relative to North America and a lot of that has to do with long term contracts Predicated on what you just said about your customers acting more quickly do these contracts still provide that chance that the international markets could bleed lower and expand out into {DATE} I do n't want you to get specific but just trying to get a general I 'm trying to handicap it myself So I do n't know if we 'll bleed lower like we did the last couple cycles or if you think {DATE} is really the ultimate trough here,4,126,1,0.007936507936507936,0.023809523809523808,0.023809523809523808,0.0,0.0,1.143676779,19.94,7359.087359999998,8,1.173266446,0.04813,2010-Feb-23,DTE

Okay First question You guys have been pretty good about identifying allocation trends and sort of getting out in front of them so that you have the right strategies in place when demand ultimately picks up so just wondering what sort of products or strategies are you currently working on or have in the pipeline that you think could be ultimately meaningful growth drivers drown the road,3,67,1,0.0,0.014925373134328358,0.014925373134328358,0.014925373134328358,0.014925373134328358,1.247898311,19.06,11571.668,11,0.475088004,2.34276,2010-Mar-03,PGR
Just one more if I could Is there something rates are still low the equity market is higher Is there a cap Could you give us quick color on kind of the capital markets dynamic and demand for these types of transactions,4,42,1,0.0,0.047619047619047616,0.047619047619047616,0.0,0.0,1.862066075,18.83,2036.26015,9,1.102216491,0.21943,2010-Mar-04,FL
If I have it right it looks like restructuring expense picked up a little bit to Was this as planned assuming I have this right or was it in response to anything that you are seeing in the environment or was there anything else that caused this to accelerate that was different than planned,2,54,1,0.0,0.0,0.018518518518518517,0.0,0.018518518518518517,1.862066075,18.83,2036.26015,9,1.102216491,0.21943,2010-Mar-04,FL

I wanted to ask about the potential for consolidation among cable and satellite companies domestically And I realize you do n't want to comment on your specific contracts But I was wondering if you 'd be willing to share some general thoughts about what happens to the affiliate contracts in the event of consolidation among {CARDINAL} cable or {CARDINAL} satellite companies Would the contracts get folded together Or do the {CARDINAL} contracts run in parallel until expiration,5,77,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.3854751280000002,17.13,3775.35792,12,0.388350092,2.33312,2010-Mar-31,GPN

Great That 's some really nice commentary I appreciate that Maybe to kind of pick up where you mentioned on competitive advantage side given how successful you 've already been and seemed to be so far does that change the appetite for maybe partnering with other large multinationals and pursuing some of the larger projects Is that still an option that you are considering when you look at particular the larger bids perhaps,5,73,1,0.0,0.0410958904109589,0.0410958904109589,0.0410958904109589,0.0,1.488787759,15.58,125406.996,6,0.375071448,2.9203900000000003,2010-Apr-13,INTC

Good {TIME} I want to go back to the same question I guess in terms of the free cash flow And I guess I 'm just trying to think about when you first came in Phebe you talked about the M&A organization as being broken and needed to be fixed And I guess I 'm wondering why we have n't seen you make more actions there Is it the budget outlook Is it the prices Is it that you see more value in the stock What would make you change your view towards buyback and start thinking about acquisitions,8,99,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.010101010101010102,0.020202020202020204,1.747670242,16.2,20733.1128,12,0.808800292,1.73594,2010-Apr-14,CSX
Okay Just one follow up for Dan The reinstatement of the share repurchase authorization can you help us with how you want us to think about that given the debt on the balance sheet from the acquisition How aggressive do you want to be And obviously recognizing as well that you will have access to a fair amount of OUS cash shortly How aggressive should we think about a buy back over {DATE},6,73,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.988241565,15.59,15050.84039,10,0.13159354199999998,3.10088,2010-Apr-15,ISRG
Then maybe more specifically on Medical Devices if I look at that business it 's still the one that remains a drag on growth despite the overall uptick in performance Can you get that back to a mid single digit growth business organically Or is that the area that requires the most focus from an external investment standpoint,3,58,1,0.0,0.017241379310344827,0.017241379310344827,0.017241379310344827,0.017241379310344827,1.352888254,15.59,19559.42368,9,0.066520618,3.38999,2010-Apr-15,YUM

It 's Michael Bilerman I just had a quick question You talked a little bit about pushing some of the redevelopment and development projects out It sounded both due to conserving some financing but also given the backdrop of the economic environment Is there any change that you are making sort of on the core strategy given what 's happening and any changes that you may be doing,5,68,1,0.0,0.014705882352941176,0.014705882352941176,0.0,0.014705882352941176,1.352888254,15.59,19559.42368,9,0.066520618,3.38999,2010-Apr-15,YUM

Thank you Good {TIME} I guess my first one for Jim you discussed Gorilla Glass missing expectations almost entirely due to touch on notebook in {CARDINAL} And touch on notebook largely disappointed as we moved through {DATE} so I 'm curious if you could comment on why touch on notebook missed expectations Is it lack of penetration in touch SKUs relative to what you were hoping for Is it sell through that was soft Is it overall consumers are actually have a preference towards tablets rather than touch on notebook What is that dynamic and then how do you expect that to change as we move into {DATE},8,108,1,0.0,0.018518518518518517,0.018518518518518517,0.009259259259259259,0.027777777777777776,1.139156467,15.89,6240.42,11,0.910104701,0.10701,2010-Apr-16,PBCT

Okay and just given some of the softness in some of the end markets although it sounds like you 're still taking share but is it more difficult to ask customers for price increases when we have seen some spot softness in some areas,1,44,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.022727272727272728,1.139156467,15.89,6240.42,11,0.910104701,0.10701,2010-Apr-16,PBCT
Hey Jim maybe I could just follow up with {CARDINAL} comment you just made here at the end The service improvements should we think about that as being able to extend the period when you can sustain {PERCENT} core pricing Or could it actually mean that contracts you 've already repriced have even more upside so we can think of maybe even growing that core price,4,66,1,0.0,0.06060606060606061,0.06060606060606061,0.030303030303030304,0.0,1.328437485,15.89,7208.33568,9,0.434532638,0.72053,2010-Apr-16,GPC
Okay great Thank you and then I guess just a broader question Were there any particular states I guess that surprised you at a positive or negative in terms of reported volumes in {DATE},3,34,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058823529411764705,0.058823529411764705,1.101301167,18.36,42135.9183,10,0.244824354,1.8483,2010-Apr-19,LLY
So maybe just quick on NIM You had some NIM compression and we obviously have a really low interest rate environment but also you 're running off obviously all of the HELOC subprime and other high interest rate loans so just thoughts on the go forward there,3,47,1,0.0,0.02127659574468085,0.02127659574468085,0.0,0.0,1.821705052,18.36,10001.3175,11,0.8880536659999999,1.90811,2010-Apr-19,MTB

Diana that makes perfect sense But if I extrapolate that further that would imply that as sales start to come back you should see at least for the near term some outsized incremental margin expansion right,2,36,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.027777777777777776,0.0,1.502410895,17.34,16990.4856,2,0.429178906,1.21453,2010-Apr-20,PCAR
Okay And then just with respect to more of a broader question what is sort of the mindset of most of the retailers that you talk to at this point on your portfolio with respect to their existing footprints and what their plans are whether to shrink those or to grow them at this point,2,55,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01818181818181818,1.232628577,17.34,2587.7824,3,0.568699707,1.27443,2010-Apr-20,SNA
Okay Great thanks And then Gregg when we last spoke to you noted that Wal Mart their rollback campaign and their price gap was in the low double digits and the number of items on rollback had increased modestly I was wondering if any of these figures have changed and if you could speak to the competitive environment particularly given that Wal Mart 's taken another step down on their deep rollback campaign,4,73,1,0.0,0.0136986301369863,0.0136986301369863,0.0136986301369863,0.0,1.425290359,17.34,24524.48688,3,0.373992819,2.75549,2010-Apr-20,ITW
Hey guys {CARDINAL} quick questions for you First of all with the discussion around the consumer business and conversion rates on the low end can you just remind us with the HP renewal when did the new economics kick in and does that give you more flexibility around this issue and should that positively impact the profitability of the consumer business,2,61,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03278688524590164,0.01639344262295082,1.649405683,17.34,224818.3908,6,0.202999127,6.16378,2010-Apr-20,AAPL
Yes And this one is probably for Keith but from the {DATE} cash statements that have come out it looks like the pool factors have been coming down a bit more slowly {DATE} to {DATE} for each securitization than in {DATE} And do you think people are paying off loans a little more slowly than they used to at the longer end of the curve And does that then result in a higher pool size and higher CAF income,4,79,1,0.0,0.0,0.012658227848101266,0.0,0.02531645569620253,1.649405683,17.34,224818.3908,6,0.202999127,6.16378,2010-Apr-20,AAPL
Okay And maybe just I mean since you include all that all those assets I believe in your AUM calculation you could take this as a suggestion maybe just may be helpful to break out those things that do n't generate asset based fees You thinking about it down the road,3,51,1,0.0,0.0784313725490196,0.09803921568627451,0.0,0.0196078431372549,1.6004397259999998,17.34,38837.87958,11,0.857735418,2.70111,2010-Apr-20,BK
And then Bats is planning to launch a primary listing market I think in {DATE} and they 're reportedly going to waive fees for listed companies that leave you or New York I just wanted to know if you 've had any conversations with any of your listed companies that may be thinking about moving and I guess just more generally how you view the competitive dynamics in the listing space,2,71,1,0.0,0.014084507042253521,0.014084507042253521,0.0,0.0,1.6004397259999998,17.34,38837.87958,11,0.857735418,2.70111,2010-Apr-20,BK
And then sorry a follow on the retail environment when they see pulp prices down as much as they are are you you tend to encounter some pressure to withdraw pricing or to fund sales in any other way retailer driven,2,41,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.120835927,15.73,8401.128,10,0.340555578,0.24957,2010-Apr-21,LH

Okay very helpful {CARDINAL} last quick {CARDINAL} and I will jump back in queue Just in terms of an O US market dynamic question if you think about your key markets maybe Japan is less relevant right now But in terms of Germany France Italy in those key markets is prostatectomy still your single biggest growth contributor So not necessarily absolute but on a growth perspective is prostatectomy still the biggest driver in those {CARDINAL} markets,5,76,1,0.0,0.013157894736842105,0.013157894736842105,0.0,0.013157894736842105,2.509807539,15.73,3468.81945,11,1.124847715,0.40313,2010-Apr-21,ETFC

Okay and then the structured finance pipeline Andrew you characterized it going into {DATE} as strong I 'm just curious given the success of the capital markets continued competition from lenders I guess not as many mezz lenders what are you seeing and given the standoff you mentioned between buyers and sellers what 's causing it to be so strong,2,60,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05,0.0,2.55372224,15.73,34789.652,12,0.253354845,1.08962,2010-Apr-21,FCX

A couple questions Are there any near term or long term impacts on the business in your view from the recent rate parity changes in Europe noting that they do n't go into effect until {DATE} And then Dara in terms of your comments around integration efforts with Wotif and the Venere consolidation are all those fully bolted on or do you still have small tasks or tweaks you need to do in terms of getting them onto commonplatforms,3,79,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.012658227848101266,0.975780677,16.32,8345.99458,10,0.296255282,0.66683,2010-Apr-22,BCR
Okay Good point And lastly the if you take the hypothetical Susan that subsequent to purchasing UST that Altria reduces premium pricing I thought {MONEY} a can to get their premium brands to gain at least some share How adverse an impact do you think that hypothetical situation would be to Conwood Do you think in that environment Conwood could still deliver some profit growth {DATE} or do you think it would n't be feasible in that circumstance,6,78,1,0.0,0.01282051282051282,0.01282051282051282,0.02564102564102564,0.01282051282051282,0.975780677,16.32,8345.99458,10,0.296255282,0.66683,2010-Apr-22,BCR
Okay sure And then my other question is you talked about the reintroduction of the Triumph this kind of marking the bottoming of the Carnival brand and I certainly understand symbolically how that would But I wonder if you could sort of translate that into more specifically you mentioned volumes have been up since then but can you talk about whether that is with price having to be down or just sort of quantifying something a little more specific to bookings to see that that was the bottom more than just kind of the symbolic reintroduction,4,96,1,0.0,0.010416666666666666,0.010416666666666666,0.0,0.010416666666666666,0.975780677,16.32,8345.99458,10,0.296255282,0.66683,2010-Apr-22,BCR
Okay I joined the call a little bit late I do n't know if you addressed it at the outset but could you Doug or anyone else talk about the credit card strategic review either that process or the feedback And then also any thoughts you could share about your real estate portfolio Are there opportunities as you look at ownership and alternative potential value creating transactions,4,67,1,0.0,0.029850746268656716,0.029850746268656716,0.014925373134328358,0.014925373134328358,1.684780306,16.32,24278.74055,11,0.925255119,0.94932,2010-Apr-22,BBT

And then my other question you 'd always stated that you did not want Dollar Tree to become just another small box grocery store that you always wanted to preserve the elements of a variety store for Dollar Tree Yet if you look at your consumable mix it continues to grow {CARDINAL} basis points {PERCENT} of your revenues Is there a line in the sand where you ask your merchants to say enough is enough and we ca n't let Dollar Tree look like all the other dollar store competitors,3,90,1,0.022222222222222223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.011111111111111112,1.909648022,16.32,54938.18232000001,11,0.298261858,1.04761,2010-Apr-22,AXP

Okay That 's helpful and then on the lab core {DATE} initiative I know you were pretty clear that we would n't see really much impact {DATE} but is there anything cost wise out there that you 're looking at that you feel like you could pull forward a bit that you might be able to realize some savings in {DATE},3,61,1,0.0,0.03278688524590164,0.03278688524590164,0.01639344262295082,0.0,2.439511262,16.32,12041.4624,11,1.275556111,2.26857,2010-Apr-22,FITB

And just as far as the timing of visibility for budgets {DATE} I know you said it 's happening towards {DATE} you think Are you seeing is that atypical of what usually happens In other words is it taking longer for that visibility to materialize compared to {DATE} or do you expect it to be consistent with {DATE},3,58,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.7543117230000003,16.32,9211.98618,6,0.535345912,2.59733,2010-Apr-22,WDC
Okay And Keith {CARDINAL} question as CP&S had been growing faster during {DATE} or in various periods guess far part of the theory was that would seed and increase your installed base so it would seed some customers for higher margin aftermarket business Is there any expectation or any sign that you would see any of that in {DATE},3,59,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01694915254237288,2.7543117230000003,16.32,9211.98618,6,0.535345912,2.59733,2010-Apr-22,WDC
Okay Great To make sure I understand what 's happening here on all of these businesses the conference constant effects have deteriorated since {DATE} but of course those were the stretch goals When we look at the slide that had the individual businesses you did n't change any of them in the slides we had {DATE} Should we expect in {DATE} that these will get revised to reflect what we are already seeing which you have left alone,5,78,1,0.0,0.0,0.01282051282051282,0.01282051282051282,0.01282051282051282,1.717885677,16.47,81518.32612,4,0.245813489,0.17756,2010-Apr-23,SLB

Okay And can I just ask {CARDINAL} last quick {CARDINAL} just on the tax rate and the outlook Is the change in the environmental liability is that does that have any impact on {DATE} Is that an ongoing thing And is that does that mean {PERCENT} is a good rate to kind of hold in for {DATE} also,5,58,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.017241379310344827,0.0,2.166303403,23.84,7425.48444,4,0.908818963,0.6403800000000001,2010-May-05,PXD
Okay Gary can you comment on {DATE} what a realistic sales growth goal would be Can you get into the sort of upper single single digit it or low double digit sales growth range in {DATE} particularly as you get the salesforce prime before {DATE} has started,3,47,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.166303403,23.84,7425.48444,4,0.908818963,0.6403800000000001,2010-May-05,PXD

{CARDINAL} follow up if I can on private label There 's been some chatter in the industry of retailers getting more aggressive on trying to put categories back out to bid to try to get some price concessions Are you seeing that in that the categories you compete in,3,49,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.065562851,23.84,10232.10682,7,1.081565274,3.58391,2010-May-05,CTL
Okay so again off {DATE} EBIT of {PERCENT} for RF tech we 'll still get some volume leverage off of that project work and our EBIT margin should work harder for the balance of {DATE},1,35,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.091792995,24.91,4787.8282,8,1.001372275,1.49794,2010-May-06,SCG
Okay and then on the detergent side you had talked about price competition You look at the leader they 're way much higher than you on price so are you seeing new competition from some of the flankers from that ar priced more in and around All I mean ARM HAMMER and Xtra,2,53,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.231519865,24.91,4004.67788,8,1.296917932,2.28607,2010-May-06,PNW

Okay I 'm trying to understand this just a little bit better Is the exposure that you incurred in as a result of some of your baseload plants being out and on a unplanned outage and you being forced to buy power Or was it from the spot power that you would buy from the peaking transaction side of it,4,60,1,0.0,0.0,0.03333333333333333,0.016666666666666666,0.05,1.231519865,24.91,4004.67788,8,1.296917932,2.28607,2010-May-06,PNW

Hey guys Thanks for taking my question I 'm calling for Romit Shah I guess when we look at your gross margin you guys are maintaining the guidance there How do we look at the volatility of that moving through the year as China LTE improves as you expect,5,49,1,0.0,0.0,0.02040816326530612,0.02040816326530612,0.04081632653061224,1.231519865,24.91,4004.67788,8,1.296917932,2.28607,2010-May-06,PNW
In refining solutions how does the adoption of relatively new products like AlkyClean factor into your outlook or are they just too small to move the needle,1,27,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.542738383,24.91,9331.19046,8,0.627647197,0.55337,2010-May-06,PPL
Okay And then my follow up on traffic {PERCENT} which I think is among the best in our space maybe across retail can you tell us how that compares Is that pretty uniform across the chain or are you seeing a mature stores versus immature stores And then your customer frequency are you seeing the same customer visit you more often or what is it Or the other side of it is I guess how are new customers or new customer acquisition trending,6,83,1,0.012048192771084338,0.012048192771084338,0.012048192771084338,0.012048192771084338,0.012048192771084338,1.87499515,24.91,28435.41825,11,1.095689966,3.2892300000000003,2010-May-06,PRU

Now the president said {TIME} he 's going to continue to grow defense while freezing most of the parts of the other federal budget He 's reaffirmed his commitment to Afghanistan and it would seem to bode well On the other hand it might bring more scrutiny since the DOD and only a few others continue to get more money I wondered if you thought there was some risk that the government might increase scrutiny there 's been some big programs with some visible disappointments I 'm sure relative to what both the contractor and the government hoped Whether you 're seeing any rumblinging of changes in the business relationship it seemed that Bob and Bill and and cater and Shea said some things need to change I know you saw them all at AIA Is Is there anything that you 're seeing or that Raytheon 's seeing that 's affecting the way the business is going And is there anything you can do to protect against what they might do to sort of insulate yourself,8,176,1,0.0,0.017045454545454544,0.022727272727272728,0.0,0.022727272727272728,2.543795446,40.95,4485.24768,11,1.311662793,1.72856,2010-May-10,LM
Couple quick questions you guys have been making some significant capital investments with some major projects I was wondering if you can give us an update of how they are developing up Are you getting traffic flow along with plan and the {CARDINAL} that stand out to me are the Meridian Speedway how much stuff is going over that line is it on plan And then the Rickenbacker I realize has just opened up but could you give us a sense of how that one is developing up as well,5,90,1,0.0,0.011111111111111112,0.011111111111111112,0.0,0.011111111111111112,1.451419063,30.84,111438.8194,6,0.398694386,3.09668,2010-May-18,HPQ
Got it Just {CARDINAL} more follow up Richard it was loud and clear as you answered Ken 's question on taking out expenses near term to accommodate some of the swings in mortgage revenue I guess no matter what we should just look to your consolidated guidance of {PERCENT} on the efficiency side as we think about the puts and takes of,4,62,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.016129032258064516,0.016129032258064516,1.451419063,30.84,111438.8194,6,0.398694386,3.09668,2010-May-18,HPQ
Thank you good {TIME} Andrew I guess you 're on the cusp here of the next Ag season selling your Enlist product I was wondering if you could talk about the challenges farmers have {DATE} with herbicide resistance and then what costs are you able to save them from using a seed contained product as opposed to a secondary herbicide treatment,3,61,1,0.0,0.01639344262295082,0.01639344262295082,0.03278688524590164,0.03278688524590164,1.490611464,30.84,18479.87375,9,0.19804448,0.4915,2010-May-18,TJX
Thank you very much John congratulations on your decision Good work {DATE} guys I had a couple questions First for you John with regards to the succession plan do have any view on whether the next CEO will be from within or without the Company And second question for you Andy on the service provider side for {DATE} flat to down sequentially Clearly you have some big opportunities and you 're making some good traction there Can you give us a little bit more color on what 's not working so well It seems like there 's no growth in that business What 's holding this back,10,107,1,0.009345794392523364,0.0,0.009345794392523364,0.028037383177570093,0.018691588785046728,1.3483034930000002,33.55,40119.98056,9,0.423857805,1.0505799999999998,2010-May-19,TGT
Right So which all makes sense mathematically but why is it incorrect to conclude based on what you said {DATE} no change to the top line that perhaps you did n't spend more a little more than expected {DATE},2,39,1,0.0,0.02564102564102564,0.02564102564102564,0.0,0.02564102564102564,1.057808053,33.55,5583.81344,1,0.43595216,1.41423,2010-May-19,HRL
Okay and then just shifting real quickly to Personal Care just fantastic numbers there And {CARDINAL} thing we noticed especially {DATE} how strong the North American volumes are and yet we all kind of know the relative stability of that market and we can sort of see the demographics I 'm just wondering how sustainable the volume growth rates are in North America Do you expect to see some moderation or do you think this is sustainable,5,77,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03896103896103896,0.0,1.057808053,33.55,5583.81344,1,0.43595216,1.41423,2010-May-19,HRL

Okay All right Thanks And then a question for Mike perhaps In terms of the deal he said that with the hospital that did slow down their purchasing decision Could you give us any idea of the demographics around those what kind of hospitals they were or what geographies that happened in,6,52,1,0.0,0.038461538461538464,0.038461538461538464,0.0,0.038461538461538464,1.922951928,22.01,5123.86632,6,0.064934535,4.92962,2010-Aug-03,PBI
Okay So just to be clear it seems to me that the risk profile around that trading business evolves to {CARDINAL} more where you 're getting appropriate load serving premiums above and beyond the wholesale prices at which you have hedged Rather than chasing load serving premiums on outside of your core contracts which is is the way things have looked through the transition is that fair translation,3,68,1,0.0,0.0,0.029411764705882353,0.0,0.0,1.922951928,22.01,5123.86632,6,0.064934535,4.92962,2010-Aug-03,PBI
Thanks I think I 'm getting something like {PERCENT} implied in your guidance for gross margins And I guess the question I have is when I look at sales of call it {CARDINAL} {CARDINAL} something like that for on {PERCENT} gross margins do I need to see revenues increase kind of in step with that to get the {DATE} or can mix alone at some point in and around the revenue levels you 're projecting for get to to me target model,3,82,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.012195121951219513,2.235527805,22.63,5038.383,8,0.687430076,2.0191,2010-Aug-04,OKE
Okay And then another question on the wealth management side when looking at the {MONEY} in outflows it 's tough to compare that to the {MONEY} because that was {DATE} but I think in the slide presentation you guys used a {MONEY} of outflow in {DATE} So one just wanted to know if that 's relatively comparable And then looks like the revenue in assets is doing well despite some attrition So when you look out over the next say {CARDINAL} to {DATE} once the full integration is in place given the scale that you have is there any reason that I guess more structurally is there any reason why you would n't potentially be able to achieve industry leading margins of say like {PERCENT},6,125,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.032,0.016,2.235527805,22.63,5038.383,8,0.687430076,2.0191,2010-Aug-04,OKE
Over {DATE} is the amount incurred over that period similar to what you expect over the coming periods Or when we 're kind of thinking about this rate proceeding going forward how does that kind of play out,2,38,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.235527805,22.63,5038.383,8,0.687430076,2.0191,2010-Aug-04,OKE

Congratulations to you and your team A quick question as we think about the difficult year that we just passed and Amphenol had to go through some difficult decisions of restructuring and cutting costs to the point about operating margins we know that the {DATE} {CARDINAL} margins operating compared to {DATE} {CARDINAL} were down {DATE} More looking forward I wonder if the linearity of the cost cutting and the leverage thereby allow us and it looks like this is true for {DATE} that {DATE} operating margin should be higher in {DATE} versus {DATE} Can you talk about does that logically make sense,5,102,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0392156862745098,2.250988704,22.63,28753.546,4,0.532065076,0.7224,2010-Aug-04,DVN

Just quickly on MAKO with the clinical trial that you 're enrolling right now I 'm looking at the website right now and it seems reasonable that it will probably take {DATE} to enroll and then I think it says here about a {DATE} follow up so we should n't expect that rollout to come before that trial is complete Is that a fair way to characterize it,5,68,1,0.0,0.0,0.029411764705882353,0.0,0.0,1.247372067,26.24,17735.77826,9,0.243834196,0.81653,2010-Aug-16,SYY

Couple things First I know we have beaten this horse dead But it 's an important detail John you talked about and I wanted to ask Because I 'm not that familiar with accounting as it relates to impairments either But as you do tests to impair long lived assets sorry assets held for sale whether long lived or otherwise Does feedback from the process as the conversations that you?ve had anything other than just net present value and cash flow estimates that an accountant would use if there were no sale conversations going on included in that impairment Is that part of the guideline of how you do that Do you think about what you might be able sell it for based on conversations you?ve had,8,127,1,0.0,0.007874015748031496,0.007874015748031496,0.007874015748031496,0.023622047244094488,1.776039399,26.1,16878.09123,9,0.19804448,0.4606,2010-Aug-17,TJX

Hi thanks for the terrific color You 've done a great job of managing SG&A. I was just curious how much of an opportunity is there moving forward especially it sounds like you might be growing your revenue base Can you keep that at the {MONEY} range or is there any chance you have additional cost saving opportunities,4,58,1,0.0,0.017241379310344827,0.017241379310344827,0.05172413793103448,0.0,1.405290589,19.56,11428.72,12,0.70168698,0.54799,2010-Nov-04,RSG
A couple of questions First can you just provide a little more specificity around the {MONEY} in restructuring spend for {DATE} In the slides you talked about over the course of {DATE} and {DATE} there was a riff of {PERCENT} You closed {CARDINAL} facilities What 's sort of this next wave entail if you will And will this be the conclusion of it in {DATE},6,65,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046153846153846156,1.275758886,19.56,6568.7875,7,0.218495688,0.88339,2010-Nov-04,SNI
Thanks for the question Gary the SKU reductions in Healthy Choice you referenced to what extent are they driven by your decision to focus on higher growth items versus the customer 's decision to concentrate a bit themselves on faster turning SKUs I 'm trying to get a sense for the risk of further SKU reductions like you saw with Healthy Choice {DATE} versus what 's being pulled back on your own,3,72,1,0.0,0.0,0.013888888888888888,0.0,0.013888888888888888,1.275758886,19.56,6568.7875,7,0.218495688,0.88339,2010-Nov-04,SNI
I was hoping to dig a little bit further into the gross margin {DATE} you got {CARDINAL} basis points of gross margin expansion It sounds like largely from the deflation element of your retail prices adjusting a little bit slowly more slowly than the wholesale prices you laid out some factors that restraint that in {DATE} like {CARDINAL} basis points for mix {CARDINAL} basis points from freight You did n't call out promotions but you made it sound like it was slightly less than that amount That would add up to around {CARDINAL} basis points So was there just less of a benefit from the deflation in {DATE} than there was in {DATE} Or was there something else going on,7,120,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.008333333333333333,0.016666666666666666,1.275758886,19.56,6568.7875,7,0.218495688,0.88339,2010-Nov-04,SNI
Okay And that 's helpful And then just in terms of your comments on what the offsets will be for gross margin investments just to clarify in your comment on labor leverage maybe can you just elaborate a bit on that And then do you think you are at the right ratio in terms of full time part time mix Or do you think there are some changes that you can move more even more to part time,5,78,1,0.0,0.01282051282051282,0.01282051282051282,0.0,0.0,1.681151586,19.56,14598.1023,4,0.7181230479999999,1.42489,2010-Nov-04,CHK
Thanks First question just on the non transaction part of the business if I look over {DATE} it looks like the organic growth is coming in {PERCENT} It seems like in some businesses like listings you have some momentum in pricing power But there are some things on the Corporate Solutions and some of the other areas where there 's this phase of repricing Then I think the initiative is then to start to grow and take market share I just want to get a sense Where are we in that stage of evolution where we see this maybe lower organic growth as you 're going through some of this repricing to the process or the point that you expect to see some acceleration once you have that behind you,8,130,1,0.0,0.007692307692307693,0.015384615384615385,0.0,0.007692307692307693,1.681151586,19.56,14598.1023,4,0.7181230479999999,1.42489,2010-Nov-04,CHK

Good {TIME} Just a couple of questions about the strength you saw in Acrobat I guess in particular could you drill down a little bit on what was behind the strength talk maybe a little bit about the importance of mix of licensing how you 're thinking about the ASP opportunity going forward Obviously it 's early but how is the cycle shaping up relative to Acrobat,4,67,1,0.0,0.029850746268656716,0.029850746268656716,0.05970149253731343,0.014925373134328358,2.534837731,18.52,4137.46944,1,1.095675786,0.58567,2010-Nov-05,MHK
Okay great And {CARDINAL} other quick things on TALX Bill first on the toll records including the backlog it looks like that was up {CARDINAL} records sequentially Should we reading into that or is that simply a matter of if you had a huge amount in the backlog that ran off you would expect that to resume its {CARDINAL} records per {CARDINAL} run rate,4,64,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.015625,0.0,1.518254735,18.52,8707.83128,11,0.396947896,0.68099,2010-Nov-05,VTR
Okay And then from a portfolio standpoint and kind of a sales standpoint you feel comfortable serving those markets with what you currently have or is there a need for further portfolio evolution to kind of cater to some of these emerging market opportunities,2,44,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.022727272727272728,0.0,1.143964874,18.52,21023.85222,7,0.191037906,1.49602,2010-Nov-05,AMT
Last question Minerals I know it 's a necessary business for you to be in longer term what do you think needs to happen Do you need to right size the business or is it just do you need to help consolidate the industry a little bit to maybe help improve the stability,3,53,1,0.0,0.018867924528301886,0.018867924528301886,0.03773584905660377,0.018867924528301886,1.143964874,18.52,21023.85222,7,0.191037906,1.49602,2010-Nov-05,AMT
And then could I just follow up on geographic anything that you saw Europe I know it 's a tough quarter because it 's European summer so it 's hard to tell if it 's weak or just the summer but it looks like aps in particular in Europe were perhaps weaker than normal,4,54,1,0.0,0.037037037037037035,0.037037037037037035,0.0,0.037037037037037035,1.075756083,18.26,17648.90127,9,0.243834196,0.05446,2010-Nov-08,SYY

Okay Also you mentioned a couple of segments that we should see some continued strength going into the rest stove {DATE} and into {DATE} you did n't really mention transport It seems like auto is snapping back harder than some of the others Is there anything below the surface that we should know,4,53,1,0.0,0.0,0.018867924528301886,0.018867924528301886,0.0,2.318067026,20.61,5392.8035,9,0.243691665,0.7670600000000001,2010-Nov-15,URBN

{CARDINAL} quick questions Can you comment on the headcount It looks like it went up by {CARDINAL} people on a sequential basis certainly a larger number than we would have expected And then the second one is just the tax rate being a little bit higher at {PERCENT} Is that purely just the function of higher North America profit,5,59,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01694915254237288,1.064417759,20.2,18310.2077,9,0.19804448,4.12976,2010-Nov-16,TJX

You mentioned that your trials business experienced some pressure in {DATE} and I guess I 'd be curious to hear a little bit more about that You have a key customer in that business Did that change or is it just the typical starts and stops that occur in the trials business,4,52,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.019230769230769232,1.713534349,16.41,8072.2945,9,0.429331644,0.57022,2010-Dec-21,KMX
Okay And I guess then as a second question or as follow up Rob you have seen some I think favorable effects {DATE} probably productivity but also I think maybe contract related in terms of some of the benefit expenses on the employee costs per worker And I am wondering if you can give some commentary looking maybe to {DATE} Would you expect some of those effects to continue or do you think the inflation on a per worker basis is likely to step up a bit,6,87,1,0.0,0.022988505747126436,0.034482758620689655,0.022988505747126436,0.011494252873563218,1.713534349,16.41,8072.2945,9,0.429331644,0.57022,2010-Dec-21,KMX

Okay thank you And then moving to your specs previously I think there 's been discussion about specs getting higher margins than dirt sales I was wondering if that was still the case And if how you 're back to David 's question about potential differentiation how you thought your differentiated spec strategy relative to some peers might have been impacting your quarter,3,63,1,0.0,0.015873015873015872,0.015873015873015872,0.0,0.015873015873015872,1.57425048,16.41,26234.19575,12,0.7057168859999999,0.42972,2010-Dec-21,CCL
This is actually Jamie Feldman You guys are in a unique perspective that you can see what the different tech demand looks like across San Francisco Boston and New York So I guess my first question is just can you talk a little bit about what they 're doing in their space and how it differs by market And along the same lines as you look forward where do you think you will see the best growth across those {CARDINAL} markets,4,81,1,0.012345679012345678,0.0,0.012345679012345678,0.012345679012345678,0.012345679012345678,1.68484143,16.27,132890.7652,11,1.5734528369999998,1.70958,2011-Apr-15,BAC
Okay So from your standpoint now the stock has done well so when you consider buyback versus the cost of reserve financing I assume that trade off is still reasonably accretive Is that something that you guys track pretty closely,3,40,1,0.0,0.0,0.025,0.0,0.0,1.178424444,16.27,8515.05457,9,0.345212886,1.6145,2011-Apr-15,GPC
Thanks As you talk about growth we are not hearing you talk about vegetables very much {DATE} the story with Seminis was that we were going to see an accelerated product launch process Then we saw Europe slow down What is the current growth view of Seminis Has that business just not panned out the way you thought it would,6,60,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.016666666666666666,0.783609387,15.32,41687.51665,10,0.321567479,1.09979,2011-Apr-18,LLY
Hey Pete just so we have a little bit of basis and as people as we start thinking {DATE} could you just give us what you think at {DATE} 's rates the FX hit would be on {DATE} just to help us a little bit calibrate our model,1,48,1,0.0,0.020833333333333332,0.020833333333333332,0.0,0.0,0.783609387,15.32,41687.51665,10,0.321567479,1.09979,2011-Apr-18,LLY
Then I get the sense that you guys believe there is enough fish to fry in the core travel market without really expanding into a lot of other peripheral areas like tourist attractions or restaurants etc Is that true or how would you describe how narrow or broad your focus is,2,51,1,0.0,0.0,0.0196078431372549,0.0,0.0,1.195055121,16.96,23336.56878,10,0.357945669,0.48062,2011-Apr-19,SYK

Fair enough Then for my follow up question the Trauma and Extremities business continues to be quite healthy That collectively is around a {MONEY} category growing mid- to upper single digits and your sales force is pretty established here You have a full portfolio of products in both areas Is this a category where over {DATE} you can essentially double your revenue base here,5,64,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03125,1.253440521,16.96,13772.85715,12,0.331005896,7.33295,2011-Apr-19,OMC
Excellent Thank you The other one is on acquisitions and on your use of equity versus cash and debt Do you look at that equally when you are contemplating offering shares for acquisitions I guess the question is is the hurdle higher if you need to issue equity versus some of the tuck ins from cash flow or debt utilization,5,60,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.016666666666666666,0.016666666666666666,1.216410091,16.96,12428.6742,11,0.508807825,1.16189,2011-Apr-19,NTRS
Hey guys thank you very much David Andy we tend to track what is reported right We 're pretty focused particularly on the linear ratings that we see and trying to figure out what 's driving ad revenues But from your guys perspective there are integrated revenues and there are digital revenues in particular that I think are probably ramping Can you give us a sense how much of the ad revenues are coming from that linear viewership right now versus the nontraditional and in a sense the non tracked by Nielsen or ratings,5,94,1,0.0,0.0,0.010638297872340425,0.0,0.0,1.414146058,16.96,36264.5312,11,0.862906658,2.7309900000000003,2011-Apr-19,BK
Okay Another question then would be just you are taking share I was wondering though if you are gaining new customers how does the profitability of a new customer compare with growing sales at an existing customer Which obviously you are doing some of that too because of the business reviews but maybe could you give us a sense of how the real growth you got {DATE} balanced between new and existing customers and then what the profit difference is,4,80,1,0.0,0.025,0.025,0.025,0.0125,0.745156577,16.96,165677.6916,10,0.342636875,3.35869,2011-Apr-19,JNJ
Okay My last question is on Compleats Since you 've seen what was a frozen entree player encroach a bit into the shelf stable category is there do you also see an opportunity to kind of do the reverse and make a name for Compleats within the frozen entree space Do you think that would do you think that would test well with consumers,4,64,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03125,0.03125,1.218303769,15.83,4522.7,11,1.064402977,3.10892,2011-Apr-20,PBCT

Thanks for letting me ask a question and congrats on {DATE} Martin {CARDINAL} question on the {DATE} WFE At {DATE} earnings call you had indicated WFE to be up {PERCENT} Now it seems you are indicating it up flat to up {PERCENT} Just wanted to understand why you are broadening the range What are some of the factors that have increased the variability in {DATE},6,65,1,0.0,0.0,0.03076923076923077,0.0,0.03076923076923077,2.49197677,15.83,4831.7434,11,1.2983866590000002,0.14587999999999998,2011-Apr-20,NDAQ
What I have noticed in the past you guys have always seemed to be a thought leader a lot of companies seem to be immolating your initiatives How long would you say your continuous improvement program has been in place and what systems are you using to continue to accelerate these programs,2,52,1,0.019230769230769232,0.0,0.0,0.019230769230769232,0.0,2.49197677,15.83,4831.7434,11,1.2983866590000002,0.14587999999999998,2011-Apr-20,NDAQ
So when you mean sorry So when you mean that you 're assessing them it 's not an assessment of we might keep it we might not it 's an assessment of how best to proceed with them,3,38,1,0.02631578947368421,0.05263157894736842,0.05263157894736842,0.02631578947368421,0.0,0.962618079,15.83,75869.53784,3,0.294874835,1.57336,2011-Apr-20,UTX
Given the duration of those liabilities obviously you can live with the higher targeted combined Can you give us a sense as to what where those targeted combines would be for that line of business,2,35,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.85897645,15.83,7122.14061,3,0.472503517,3.07963,2011-Apr-20,TXT
Okay And then with regards to the carry over from {DATE} you had some orders that got pushed through and then the Easter impact could you just quantify the impact of what that was and then also the margin contribution {DATE} from FX mix and cost reduction,2,47,1,0.0,0.02127659574468085,0.02127659574468085,0.0,0.0,1.287693245,15.83,47750.73924,12,0.643709373,0.53368,2011-Apr-20,UNP
Okay And Wes last question for you on the credit business can you just maybe put a little bit more color around what you experienced with the business in {DATE} and the level of the dollar number that you took in versus your plans and how you are thinking about that for {DATE} in the SG&A,2,56,1,0.0,0.017857142857142856,0.017857142857142856,0.0,0.017857142857142856,2.492570656,15.83,1909.8135,12,0.264660026,1.5761,2011-Apr-20,URI
Okay And then can you just talk about headcount trends What actions you took during {DATE} and how you 're thinking about staffing level for {DATE},3,26,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.536522166,15.83,158757.4818,11,0.721856361,0.30917,2011-Apr-20,WFC
Okay Then just the last question is obviously inventories on your own balance sheet others balance sheets and in the channel have improved significantly Usually there is a bit of a lag effect before that starts to impact the OEM pricing negotiations Have you started to see any rationality appear there at the OEM level Are they starting to recognize that they are n't going to get the types of ASP declines that they 've gotten in {DATE},5,78,1,0.0,0.0,0.01282051282051282,0.01282051282051282,0.038461538461538464,1.536522166,15.83,158757.4818,11,0.721856361,0.30917,2011-Apr-20,WFC
Thanks I noticed that you reduced the debt levels again in {DATE} I wonder how you are thinking about what your intentions were Do you expect that to continue in {DATE},4,31,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.829341842,15.07,9417.26355,6,0.675904555,0.031310000000000004,2011-Apr-21,WDC
Can we just talk about the sales line a little bit particularly in the Grocery Products group You highlighted several key factors And I understand that commodities exposure and what 's going on there but could you talk about the what you saw in the Grocery Products group in terms of like what was the impact of Carapelli what 's the impact of Microwave what was the impact of promotional if you could maybe give us some sense of the scope and the size there,4,85,1,0.0,0.03529411764705882,0.047058823529411764,0.0,0.0,1.3925698830000002,15.83,7550.20008,6,0.023805843,4.1324,2011-Apr-20,LLTC
Thanks Gregg you started to answer it there In {PERCENT} comp plan {DATE} what is the traffic versus ticket mix that 's implicit in that and also the deflation part of it,3,32,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.838089107,15.83,5560.28956,11,0.77862651,1.36426,2011-Apr-20,HBAN
Okay So even though the rates {DATE} would imply that the exchange would be more favorable on the top line over the course of {DATE},2,25,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04,0.0,1.838089107,15.83,5560.28956,11,0.77862651,1.36426,2011-Apr-20,HBAN
So a couple of things The lower business transformation expense {DATE} is that simply a timing issue that it gets pushed out to {DATE} or is that a true reduction in cost,2,32,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.45822366,15.83,312437.7151,6,0.200422085,3.81732,2011-Apr-20,AAPL
It 's Brian Maguire on for Bob {DATE} Just kind of a follow up to that last one just talking about the European volumes packaged gas down {PERCENT} new overall volumes down couple of percent Any kind of change in regional trends within Europe where you are saying any improvement below the surface that might be a leading indicator for things getting better,3,63,1,0.0,0.015873015873015872,0.015873015873015872,0.047619047619047616,0.0,1.556023853,15.83,9074.67572,6,0.250481303,0.5855600000000001,2011-Apr-20,APH
Just a follow up question on the {CARDINAL} acquisitions Sandeep you mentioned you got an attractive price since these assets were not marketed for sale so I 'm curious how attractive that price was Do you have any thoughts on what the cap rate would have been on a formally marketed sale for those {CARDINAL} assets,3,56,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03571428571428571,0.017857142857142856,1.18389188,15.83,10064.4432,10,0.458711319,2.83544,2011-Apr-20,DGX
Got it so is slowing down from {PERCENT} to {PERCENT} at the midpoint of your guidance Does that mean that there is still transitions taking place as some of these changes take effect,2,33,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.030303030303030304,1.424904508,15.83,27951.39152,12,0.657770553,0.35051,2011-Apr-20,CSX
So it would be fair to say that type of service would be part of your long term strategies {CARDINAL} way or another either in the current form or maybe tweaked a little bit correct,1,35,1,0.0,0.02857142857142857,0.02857142857142857,0.0,0.0,2.314550185,15.83,48658.74492,12,0.270996047,3.44436,2011-Apr-20,FCX
Good {TIME} Just in terms of some of the stress that we 're seeing in these value supermarkets or grocers do you think you could see opportunities emerge similar to your experience with Albertsons And if an opportunity did emerge would partaking in something be consistent with your current strategy,3,50,1,0.0,0.02,0.02,0.06,0.02,1.743450469,15.83,3907.34482,11,1.14687858,1.98611,2011-Apr-20,ETFC

Randy I just wanted to follow up on Jimmy 's last question on the share repurchase Interested in your comment about wanting to overachieve again {DATE} like I think you did {DATE} If you did do more than the {MONEY} should we be thinking about a higher level of reserve financings being the primary driver there or is there something else that you are thinking about that could influence the pace of buyback,3,73,1,0.0,0.0136986301369863,0.0136986301369863,0.0,0.0136986301369863,2.155568512,15.07,9738.47908,4,0.419710632,0.42573,2011-Apr-21,NFX

I had a question more about the compression issues that were brought up earlier on the Fayetteville When you look at the reserves that were I guess impaired at {DATE} how much of that was a result of I guess the compression needs there in the field,2,47,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0425531914893617,1.03159251,15.07,9679.0,10,0.340841639,1.30692,2011-Apr-21,LH
Thanks Good {TIME} Just back to your comments Christine about the {MONEY} in cost savings and I think Ron too you that you were going to try and get more aggressive with the cost savings because of the reduction in the sales expectation Could we see more than the {MONEY} {DATE} or is this over {DATE},4,56,1,0.0,0.017857142857142856,0.017857142857142856,0.017857142857142856,0.0,1.895051705,15.07,14801.1147,11,1.222857758,3.13855,2011-Apr-21,STI
Great and then finally I ca n't remember who mentioned it but there was restructuring costs that you guys were just expensing as it goes on Christine could you help us understand to put that into some context as to maybe how much of the deleverage that would have been or when the peak {CARDINAL} of those sort of costs you expect,2,62,1,0.0,0.03225806451612903,0.03225806451612903,0.016129032258064516,0.016129032258064516,1.895051705,15.07,14801.1147,11,1.222857758,3.13855,2011-Apr-21,STI

Yes Yes Great I mean that 's what we 're hearing too So it 's good to see that And just if I could ask a question on hedging I know you typically like to that more just to mitigate upswings in fuel but could you opportunistically maybe hedge some more Is that something you would consider strategically or not,7,60,1,0.0,0.05,0.05,0.03333333333333333,0.03333333333333333,1.319391694,15.07,20142.3024,5,0.332181926,2.28936,2011-Apr-21,APD
Hi Thanks for taking my questions My first one would you say that the pickup growth pickup in growth rates in tech have been mostly due to your headcount additions Or are there any other drivers besides the strong end market that you would care to call out,4,48,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.020833333333333332,0.020833333333333332,1.319391694,15.07,20142.3024,5,0.332181926,2.28936,2011-Apr-21,APD
Any sort of color around just sort of thinking about the reinvestment in terms of the potential size of this it sounds like you guys have come together and it sounds like this is different commentary than what you 've said in the past I understand you 're constantly evaluating portfolios but should we think about this as a material piece of your current relationship,2,65,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.203069341,15.07,46115.36424,3,0.27152421600000004,4.1289099999999985,2011-Apr-21,HON
When you see high end brands like Scania and DAF gaining market share at the high end of the market what is your general interpretation of that trend going on in Europe particularly in the sense that normally if you see the premium brands gaining share that 's a pretty good indication of underlying health in the marketplace,1,58,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05172413793103448,0.0,1.203069341,15.07,46115.36424,3,0.27152421600000004,4.1289099999999985,2011-Apr-21,HON
Okay and then going back I want to go back to the Harvest acquisition We 'll see if you answer it but just standing back and thinking about the issue with the Uinta has always been you ca n't ramp fast enough ca n't get permits fast enough etcetera this obviously on the permitting front improves it but is this acreage going to take place of other acreage you would have drilled Is it upgraded acreage or should we think about it more like you finally get not finally but you 've talked about getting refinery and another agreement out there and maybe that 's what you 're talking about as far as solutions to accelerate How do you get value out of harvest I guess is the question,8,129,1,0.007751937984496124,0.007751937984496124,0.007751937984496124,0.007751937984496124,0.007751937984496124,1.203069341,15.07,46115.36424,3,0.27152421600000004,4.1289099999999985,2011-Apr-21,HON
Good {TIME} Back to the margin outlook on the core margin what gives you confidence that the core margin flattens out in {DATE} excluding rates and excluding deals following the compression you do expect in {DATE} and the compression we saw {DATE},2,42,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.023809523809523808,0.0,1.615043635,15.07,12543.83548,3,0.450250641,2.56684,2011-Apr-21,DOV
Okay And {CARDINAL} follow up shifting to the east coast As you look at markets like Boston and New York obviously condos in the city are very pricey People are if they want to be in the city running the most attractive option Given the public transportation systems that goes with those markets there 's always options if somebody really wants to get out if they 're willing to stomach a commute to save money Are you seeing anything in those markets whether it be move out to buy ratios or sort of where people are interested in renting that would indicate that there 's some potential rent fatigue there,6,110,1,0.00909090909090909,0.0,0.0,0.00909090909090909,0.0,1.28712783,15.07,35527.097839999995,6,0.442854911,2.64568,2011-Apr-21,DHR

Okay if I could ask {CARDINAL} quick follow up here for Mike Mike you mentioned Sharp and their Gen project and it seems like they 're the first customer that 's potentially running both LCD panels and thin film solar panels together to sort of balance out utilization rates Is that true and is that a trend we could see with other kind of higher Gen flat panel manufacturers,3,69,1,0.0,0.028985507246376812,0.043478260869565216,0.0,0.0,1.083011847,15.77,3686.3946,12,0.429057283,0.18999,2011-Apr-26,TSS
Okay Hitting the trim line topic I appreciate your color there but I think the critical point here is that right now is the trim line that we are seeing especially in {DATE} of growth the top end being {PERCENT} maybe a little bit slower is that the kind of growth we should expect going forward Or can we actually see a rebound and somewhat of an acceleration as we head out of {DATE},5,74,1,0.0,0.02702702702702703,0.02702702702702703,0.013513513513513514,0.02702702702702703,1.452668983,15.77,13013.0325,12,0.090426798,0.98914,2011-Apr-26,CHRW

That 's helpful Very helpful in term of the M&A. If I could add {CARDINAL} other question with regard to just the SG&A and cost base as we get into {DATE} You talked about in terms of SG&A obviously a {DATE} higher level in terms of utilities Do we stay at that level {DATE} high is this a good base in terms of that seasonality as be go into {DATE} and just the impact of the additional sales force you talked about at length on the call what sort of incremental impact does that have to SG&A as we get into {DATE} and think about the run rate going into {DATE},5,111,1,0.0,0.009009009009009009,0.009009009009009009,0.009009009009009009,0.018018018018018018,1.1644458009999998,17.08,24241.45834,7,0.852995229,0.07074,2011-May-05,CTL

Okay Last question here sort of back on the pricing You mentioned that there were some pressures and you touched on competitive pressures from rail I was wondering Don if you could perhaps elaborate on that a little bit particularly are we seeing significant inter rail competition Or if you could sort of give an order of magnitude what the from the pressure perspective which were the main components of that pressure versus some of the others in sort of an order of magnitude,5,84,1,0.0,0.03571428571428571,0.03571428571428571,0.0,0.011904761904761904,1.4254217340000002,33.39,174807.1817,10,0.342636875,1.60753,2011-Oct-18,JNJ
Okay {CARDINAL} very quick follow up just on the synergies I think {DATE} you guys said you expected {MONEY} of incremental synergies {DATE} put up {MONEY} I think incremental in {DATE} It sounds as though with the network stuff and with the systems conversions coming in early are we still on pace for {MONEY} Could we beat the {MONEY} How should we think about that,6,65,1,0.0,0.015384615384615385,0.015384615384615385,0.0,0.0,2.661489181,33.39,11681.9714,12,0.331005896,0.9531,2011-Oct-18,OMC

A couple of quick questions here {CARDINAL} on the productivity side I am trying to parse out the drivers Obviously you are pricing above cost inflation here But also you have seemed to push a lot more freight onto areas like the Heartland Corridor which a lot is double stacked and you 're getting benefit there plus a lot of your trainees are coming online working If you are to bucket them could you split it out for us what has been driving the main productivity here at Norfolk Southern,5,90,1,0.0,0.011111111111111112,0.011111111111111112,0.011111111111111112,0.011111111111111112,2.120256452,33.39,390342.4766,6,0.239236755,0.7066100000000001,2011-Oct-18,AAPL
Then David just a question of around deferred revenue I think it was alluded to these more ELA style transactions Anyway you could help us understand how much more license revenue is going into deferred that {DATE} you would n't have seen going into deferred and it would 've been taken upfront,3,52,1,0.0,0.019230769230769232,0.019230769230769232,0.0,0.019230769230769232,2.75121434,31.56,12303.64202,10,0.332883119,2.11986,2011-Oct-19,STJ^A17

{CARDINAL} follow up for you As we look at certainly very good performance in margins in {DATE} and everything I think you 've outlined from a pricing and activity standpoint suggests margins just continue to improve here I 'm just curious your thoughts as we continue to see mobilization of people and tools for you into these incremental opportunities in the deepwater contracts Is there any expected margin drag you anticipate on your international businesses as a result,4,78,1,0.0,0.01282051282051282,0.02564102564102564,0.038461538461538464,0.01282051282051282,5.999916995,31.56,1319.13522,12,0.264660026,2.9701,2011-Oct-19,URI
{CARDINAL} questions {CARDINAL} related to the utilities Utilities posted great quarters especially SDG&E and especially given the challenge of not having a rate order in hand If we go back and look at PG&E 's {DATE} from {DATE} or Southern Cal Edison from {DATE} both had pretty significant challenges in terms of {DATE} earnings at the utility Can you talk a little bit about what the drivers were at SDG&E Was it all just AFUDC Was there a significant change in the O&M level A significant change in the cost structure et cetera,8,93,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.010752688172043012,0.03225806451612903,3.750364392,31.56,6293.4534,6,0.647433977,4.3330199999999985,2011-Oct-19,WDC

Good {TIME} Lauralee if we look at your comments on ManorCare EBITDAR there declined again You talk about attractive rental increases which is good for HCP but bad for the coverages and then you also talk about positive trends coming Those sort of all work together and against each other but then you also mentioned exiting from underperforming assets Would those be exits from assets that HCP owns How do you think about that in terms of lost NOI and also what 's the magnitude of assets that are underperforming that if they lose then the coverage will go up,6,100,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04,0.07,3.340476647,31.56,21108.315,11,0.866445598,0.97294,2011-Oct-19,BLK
Okay Then in terms of your floor income and locking in floor income through hedges I think it gets cheaper for you to actually lock those in through those forward contracts as rates rise So what 's your thinking around locking in additional floor income How much would rates need to increase before you maybe have an increased appetite for locking in that floor income,4,65,1,0.0,0.015384615384615385,0.015384615384615385,0.0,0.0,3.340476647,31.56,21108.315,11,0.866445598,0.97294,2011-Oct-19,BLK
Just kind of thinking about in the past you have talked about return on inventory Your lot supply is down I will call it close to {DATE} supply looking forward to {DATE} And it looks like inventory growth is slowing down especially with land held for development coming off the balance sheet What are the opportunities to improve returns on assets as well as how do you think about leverage in that context for ROE,5,75,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02666666666666667,0.013333333333333334,3.0908682130000003,31.56,22405.99702,12,0.657770553,0.12142,2011-Oct-19,CSX
Hey guys Thanks for letting me in under the wire here A couple things First of all I guess obviously we did see at least a slight deceleration in auto despite what seemed to be pretty favorable weather for most of {DATE} So for the sake of focusing on an admittedly short term issue I guess the question is probably for Paul Do you have concerns that we could start to see a little bit of incremental softening if the mild weather we 've seen for most of the fall here continue deeper into {DATE},6,95,1,0.0,0.010526315789473684,0.021052631578947368,0.021052631578947368,0.021052631578947368,2.16866342,31.56,7041.929,6,0.081927775,0.84983,2011-Oct-19,LLTC
Jack just a question on how you are viewing the recent trends in your business And I know you mentioned that {DATE} and {DATE} were a little slower than {DATE} Do you think you 've seen a change in the underlying momentum of the business Or was that just moreso related to the benefit you saw from the buy one get {CARDINAL} free promotion,4,64,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.015625,0.03125,2.16866342,31.56,7041.929,6,0.081927775,0.84983,2011-Oct-19,LLTC

Hi good {TIME} Thanks for taking the question Can you discuss where you are with the XFINITY rebranding campaign and how close you are to completion of that project It appears to have been very successful and unique Would you expect a change in PSU growth as that process slows Or do you think that it has n't provided you with a big boost in terms of PSU growth,6,69,1,0.0,0.014492753623188406,0.014492753623188406,0.043478260869565216,0.014492753623188406,2.010639661,34.44,228222.4977,6,0.268803725,0.12769,2011-Oct-20,MSFT
Okay And then Rich on the capital allocation theme that I think you have laid out and executed pretty well on I guess the next potential piece of the puzzle could be share buybacks How do we think about that When can that potentially start to materialize,4,47,1,0.0,0.02127659574468085,0.02127659574468085,0.0,0.0,2.010639661,34.44,228222.4977,6,0.268803725,0.12769,2011-Oct-20,MSFT
Got you And then on another topic you touched on this with the higher inventory balance but I was just wondering given the supply chain efforts you 're working on does that should we take that to mean that your in stock positions are still at a pretty comparable and strong level,3,52,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.019230769230769232,0.0,3.046039524,34.44,11042.78967,3,0.54692087,0.8736299999999999,2011-Oct-20,NUE
Okay And then just {CARDINAL} more question from me You had mentioned a couple of times that the mix in PSM has been fairly negative Can you talk a little bit about what 's been driving that and when have you seen historically that that mix that that negative mix shift tends to bottom,4,54,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05555555555555555,3.057755773,34.44,2873.61972,3,0.450464189,0.42332,2011-Oct-20,SNA
Okay Then lastly just in terms of the Western business as a whole can you give us a sense of you know first off the commentary they 're getting back from clients you mentioned that a lot of your managers are out making outbound calls Some of the commentary that they 're seeing from investors Then also is there a pipeline for mandates and how you 're kind of and how they are positioned to benefit over kind of {DATE},4,80,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0125,0.0,3.057755773,34.44,2873.61972,3,0.450464189,0.42332,2011-Oct-20,SNA

Okay fair enough And I guess just trying to get you to slice it more maybe On the esoteric side of the business that was obviously pretty strong and seemed to be strong sort of ex Genzyme as well Can you maybe talk to and I know you 're not disclosing the specific segments anymore but maybe the histology side of the business is that in sourcing still moderating as you talked to {DATE},4,74,1,0.0,0.04054054054054054,0.04054054054054054,0.02702702702702703,0.013513513513513514,2.7106138630000003,34.44,30219.2644,6,0.442854911,1.7974599999999998,2011-Oct-20,DHR

Okay A separate question you mentioned I think it was end of {CARDINAL} that you had done the internal study and changed some of the metrics that you guys manage your business around Now you 've had some time since that How would you describe the internal morale around these decisions and the change in strategy Are the people that are in place {DATE} fully bought in or is that still a process,5,73,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0136986301369863,3.762356454,34.78,6295.80861,12,0.584088715,1.80292,2011-Oct-21,KSU
And a final {CARDINAL} Tim I think that 's {CARDINAL} potential option in terms of the transportation side to well the bitumen directly down to the Gulf Coast and then in return car to bring the condensate up to the Alberta given that 's a natural position there Have you guys looked at that as a possibility And if you have any type of cost estimate if you do a round trip like that what may be the cost comparing to the pipeline cost may look like,4,87,1,0.0,0.022988505747126436,0.034482758620689655,0.0,0.0,3.762356454,34.78,6295.80861,12,0.584088715,1.80292,2011-Oct-21,KSU

Great As a follow up you have elected to leave the {CARDINAL} time non cash foreign exchange gain of {MONEY} in the numbers You have been very overt and clear about what you are doing there but maybe you can just address why you have elected to leave that in when there is a whole variety of other adjustments in {DATE},3,61,1,0.0,0.01639344262295082,0.01639344262295082,0.03278688524590164,0.0,3.4368325580000003,29.26,15176.278,2,0.282341007,2.19705,2011-Oct-25,PCAR
And Greg just as a follow up to that I noticed in the press release that there was some language from you about looking for further opportunities to improve operational efficiency And I know that clearly it is too early to ask what those are but should we expect when you take over in {DATE} a deeper dive into the expense base in Fifth Third And that we may hear about perhaps more efficiencies at some point {DATE},4,78,1,0.01282051282051282,0.02564102564102564,0.02564102564102564,0.05128205128205128,0.0,2.555923302,29.26,58309.66847999999,10,0.25813874600000003,1.80172,2011-Oct-25,MMM
Okay And just curious on the free cash flow outlook I know that did n't change for {DATE} despite the increase in the earnings guidance Any particular driver,4,28,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03571428571428571,0.0,3.21741203,29.26,11227.792,6,0.748753178,1.10619,2011-Oct-25,XRX

Okay And just to finish off the point and the search trends how long it 's taking to complete a search how is that going,2,25,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.21741203,29.26,11227.792,6,0.748753178,1.10619,2011-Oct-25,XRX
That explains And then in terms of the competitive environment I feel as Mike just pointed out your assets are growing at above market appreciation rates so it is clear that especially on the global side you have done well for {DATE} taking share there You have done it through JVs at times but mostly on the organic front My question is there are plenty of owners of these businesses that have their own share of issues and need to delever and raise capital You certainly are more than capable of winning them {CARDINAL} client at a time like you always have But any thoughts on more of a bulk deal along the way,6,114,1,0.008771929824561403,0.0,0.0,0.008771929824561403,0.008771929824561403,2.196224267,29.26,12602.27814,5,0.187191232,0.20189,2011-Oct-25,ECL
So wanted to start with I guess your comments around cost savings and the progress you made so far So if you strip out I guess a couple of {CARDINAL} offs I mean it looks like the pretax margin {DATE} was {PERCENT} maybe a little {PERCENT} Mike how should we think I guess about that as we progress through the next kind of year and a half and what do you guys see yourself kind of finishing {DATE} from a pretax margin perspective,3,83,1,0.0,0.012048192771084338,0.012048192771084338,0.024096385542168676,0.0,2.620225055,32.22,24128.56012,12,0.79097376,5.76129,2011-Oct-26,NSC
Okay thank you There 's been an increase in press and speculation regarding the potential benefits of a breakup or more significant restructuring of the Company Can you review how you think about the long term benefits of HP 's current structure and are you still committed to turning around HP while keeping the core divisions together,3,57,1,0.0,0.0,0.017543859649122806,0.0,0.017543859649122806,2.620225055,32.22,24128.56012,12,0.79097376,5.76129,2011-Oct-26,NSC

You know maybe turning to the obligatory section on M&A you guys have been more active on the tuck in side It 's actually contradictory to what we 're seeing in the market I was listening to our company 's call before and there 's been a lot of large transactions versus small which is not unusual given where we are in the cycle I guess as your thinking about the pipeline and the components of value you 're seeing in different sub segments how would you characterize for life sciences and diagnostics and the various areas you touch activity levels And more so on the mid size because it seems like that 's where you 've been more active how the sourcing and pacing of deals is trending,5,129,1,0.0,0.007751937984496124,0.023255813953488372,0.0,0.007751937984496124,3.654874208,32.22,4330.9752,11,1.2983866590000002,0.02014,2011-Oct-26,NDAQ
Okay and then just {CARDINAL} more quick ones On the utilization Ben you mentioned that obviously there could be {CARDINAL} things that impacted utilization {DATE} {CARDINAL} being obviously seasonality and the other one was geographic mix Historically you 've been up on utilization sequentially even in sort of a slowish {DATE} So is the bigger driver this {CARDINAL} international versus utilization or are they about even,4,66,1,0.0,0.015151515151515152,0.015151515151515152,0.0,0.0,3.207535917,32.22,2783.43785,3,0.368801066,1.4517,2011-Oct-26,AVY
Okay And then last question on the factors driving down the SG&A expense as percent of revs are these kind of things sustainable and should we expect this to continue in the future Was it part of the utilization increase or was it a kind of a {CARDINAL} time thing in {DATE},3,52,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.019230769230769232,4.487095587,32.22,4182.816,6,0.248028081,0.8401799999999999,2011-Oct-26,AKAM
Good {TIME} Real quick question for Adam touch on it real quick in terms of once Independence gets moves over to South Hampton {DATE} what kind of demand have you seen so far for that ship just because it 's a ship of that size and never really been seen in that region before,2,54,1,0.018518518518518517,0.0,0.0,0.018518518518518517,0.018518518518518517,2.507456544,32.22,3442.98798,11,0.376173122,0.4661,2011-Oct-26,AJG
And would you expect that going forward,1,7,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.599990547,32.22,28038.49852,8,0.732277465,0.8109999999999999,2011-Oct-26,EXC
Yes good {TIME} A couple things one with when the Dreamliner finally begins to ship in quantity can you give us any idea of what kind of boost in PST sales and earnings we might see from that higher activity,3,40,1,0.0,0.025,0.025,0.05,0.0,2.864200593,32.22,20327.09979,6,0.786726145,0.06219,2011-Oct-26,TMO
And then on the perm side obviously on the business there is some lag effect as folks generated business or produce business in {DATE} so would you sort of assume that these are peak margins for {DATE} in perm and that they would moderate somewhat as we progress {DATE} through the back {CARDINAL},1,53,1,0.0,0.018867924528301886,0.03773584905660377,0.018867924528301886,0.018867924528301886,2.864200593,32.22,20327.09979,6,0.786726145,0.06219,2011-Oct-26,TMO
Okay And could you comment on perhaps the incremental profitability of some of the faster growing services within HRS like health and benefit services is that possible,2,27,1,0.0,0.1111111111111111,0.1111111111111111,0.07407407407407407,0.0,2.572182535,32.22,7173.5032,12,0.184272552,1.0,2011-Oct-26,SRCL
And then with a strong balance sheet and an encouraging outlook for {DATE} free cash flow can you highlight your plans for use of excess cash in {DATE},1,28,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07142857142857142,0.0,2.572182535,32.22,7173.5032,12,0.184272552,1.0,2011-Oct-26,SRCL
Last question and probably more philosophical Clearly some of the regional players out there are I guess in more difficulty than you guys are at this point in the cycle What is the thought process in terms of do you prefer greenfield starts or do you prefer to make a larger acquisition,3,52,1,0.019230769230769232,0.0,0.019230769230769232,0.0,0.038461538461538464,4.099988814,29.86,3974.1540000000014,11,1.113471219,0.29075,2011-Oct-27,LM
And what in terms of the ripple effect I mean there 's some level loading going on where other productions should benefit Have you factored that in as well,2,29,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.034482758620689655,0.0,4.772261171999999,29.86,6275.34915,12,0.782709848,1.14337,2011-Oct-27,RCL
Got it When you talk about RPM and you talked about the retirements the {CARDINAL} gigawatt number you mentioned as a certainty can you give a little more clarity on that,2,31,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.772261171999999,29.86,6275.34915,12,0.782709848,1.14337,2011-Oct-27,RCL
Okay And then Oscar just to clarify that last remark If you talk about the operating margin or operating ratio you had talked about it not reaching your {PERCENT} target for {DATE} And it seemed to be because of the volumes being weaker than anticipated Do you need those volumes or am I hearing you that with some of these service and other things that you have put in place that is a bigger focus for getting that back on track,5,81,1,0.0,0.0,0.012345679012345678,0.0,0.012345679012345678,4.772261171999999,29.86,6275.34915,12,0.782709848,1.14337,2011-Oct-27,RCL
A question on the development which you include now in the supplemental on page {CARDINAL} you have {MONEY} of spend that is listed the majority of which is the {CARDINAL} asset for PMB and then Brookdale And then Ray I think you talked {MONEY} of potential new MOB development that you are targeting How should we think about development spend in that portion on your business in terms of driving growth,3,71,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.014084507042253521,2.300048383,29.86,15708.81186,6,0.509795783,2.01392,2011-Oct-27,MSI
Thanks Appreciate the color {CARDINAL} last question On Residential Mortgage you committed {MONEY} to the balance sheet in {DATE} If you could comment maybe on type of product and whether we could see this continued commitment on into {DATE},5,39,1,0.0,0.07692307692307693,0.07692307692307693,0.0,0.02564102564102564,3.941955118,29.86,6004.6437,11,0.84869697,0.10214,2011-Oct-27,SLG
Congratulations on {DATE} I have got just a little quick question with the move and development to maybe some more new construction unit is there anything we should be thinking about when modeling that in terms of differences in square footages or build costs or average unit volumes on the new units,2,52,1,0.0,0.019230769230769232,0.019230769230769232,0.0,0.019230769230769232,4.166970307,29.86,6727.94316,12,0.4240105770000001,0.9105,2011-Oct-27,UAL
Okay And then your closings {DATE} obviously there is a different variety of ways to think about or forecast but you were very specific Was in terms of its conversion rate Was weather the factor that led to the higher volume of closings,4,43,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046511627906976744,4.166970307,29.86,6727.94316,12,0.4240105770000001,0.9105,2011-Oct-27,UAL
Okay Can I ask for some color then around you mentioned the tanks and progress on the tanks taking the team off path I think you said Did you mean they were going faster or slower or what was unusual about that in your sense,4,45,1,0.0,0.0,0.022222222222222223,0.022222222222222223,0.022222222222222223,1.528619525,29.86,12346.51236,8,1.018269031,2.07141,2011-Oct-27,XEL
Can you talk a little bit more about the growth for NBPT Is it the international distribution that 's driving the growth there And given the domestic measures and volumes we 're hearing from some of the fertilizer companies for this fall I guess is there any risk of shortage or maybe I guess I would 've expected maybe to be a little bit stronger because of the nitrogen volumes,3,70,1,0.0,0.02857142857142857,0.04285714285714286,0.014285714285714285,0.014285714285714285,2.289638354,29.86,394171.6631,4,0.49988123,0.20211,2011-Oct-27,XOM
Okay And {CARDINAL} last question just on you guys buying back stock just maybe what 's how did that decision how did you come to that decision and does that reflect on perhaps a lack of acquisition opportunities out there Historically you guys have been pretty good buyers of your stock and it 's performed well after you 've bought it Just curious as to with such a lack of visibility out there on the macro why step up and do it now,6,83,1,0.0,0.024096385542168676,0.024096385542168676,0.024096385542168676,0.03614457831325301,2.289638354,29.86,394171.6631,4,0.49988123,0.20211,2011-Oct-27,XOM

My first question is a follow up to Ken Usdin 's question You 've often talked about your short duration securities portfolio as dry powder and I heard your message loud and clear in terms of opting to retain auto loans instead I guess could you remind us on what your concentration sensitivity is in terms of auto loans the percentage of your loan book And would that be a signal that you may lever your balance sheet more aggressively if you reach that limit,4,85,1,0.0,0.023529411764705882,0.023529411764705882,0.0,0.023529411764705882,3.122207675,29.86,4182.383,11,0.848386283,1.97774,2011-Oct-27,TMK
Good {TIME} thanks for taking my call I know you guys talked a little bit about what you thought debt levels how much they would come down at {DATE} but you have a fair amount of debt coming due over {DATE} Can you talk about how you 're thinking about either refinancing or paying down some portion of that to kind of expedite getting back to that investment grade rating,3,70,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.014285714285714285,0.0,3.122207675,29.86,4182.383,11,0.848386283,1.97774,2011-Oct-27,TMK

Yes makes sense just wanted to double check And then second question is on capital levels when you guys look at the whole co and the leverage ratio there historically used to be a concerning factor for you guys as well Clearly not any more You guys have {PERCENT} {PERCENT} than that 's not including I guess the {MONEY} you 're getting for the market maker The question is you guys still have {DATE} or so until you can start reducing the debt the first traunch I guess of the debt in {DATE} Is there anything else you guys can do with the capital flexibility in the interim rights over {DATE} whether it 's a buy back or maybe starting to bring some of the deposits back on the balance sheet because again as I said now you have help the capital flexibility Help us understand what 's the plan until you can start reducing the corporate debt,8,158,1,0.006329113924050633,0.006329113924050633,0.006329113924050633,0.0,0.012658227848101266,1.42645567,29.86,9988.10376,1,0.08429342699999999,0.03096,2011-Oct-27,HSY

On the natural resources you mentioned that {CARDINAL} of the new criticized loans was in that sector So could you just give us a bit more detail on what the total exposure to that sector looks like and how it breaks down between oil and gas mining outlet and the components of natural resources,2,54,1,0.0,0.018518518518518517,0.037037037037037035,0.0,0.037037037037037035,3.184775097,29.86,11175.71382,6,0.241603069,0.84375,2011-Oct-27,CERN

Regarding the margin outlook I know you had indicated stable for the core margin in {DATE} That implies I guess that Susquehanna has no real benefit to the margin despite having a somewhat higher margin I guess So is that the case And or is there any other factor impacting that,4,51,1,0.0,0.0196078431372549,0.0196078431372549,0.058823529411764705,0.0,2.539330335,29.86,5680.16096,3,0.273965306,1.36532,2011-Oct-27,BLL

Okay The second question when I 'm looking at Imperial in {DATE} the report downstream earnings of {CARDINAL} So if we adjust for your working interest and the foreign currency it would suggest that your share of the downstream earning is {MONEY} Meanwhile that you 're low on US downstream only report {MONEY} If that means that outside Canada the rest of your global downstream operation actually lost {MONEY} Or that is some different other accounting adjustment that we can weigh on,6,82,1,0.0,0.012195121951219513,0.012195121951219513,0.0,0.024390243902439025,3.66026013,29.86,11962.19518,6,0.199045143,5.5652,2011-Oct-27,CTXS
Thank you good {TIME} gentlemen I have a follow up on Dave Bragg 's question about personal income growth I was actually surprised at how robust the projections are Does this basically negate investor concerns about rent to income ratios and to the extent you have such concerns do those vary across your brands,4,54,1,0.0,0.0,0.018518518518518517,0.018518518518518517,0.05555555555555555,2.9100392910000004,29.86,6116.0544,11,0.307095182,0.09705,2011-Oct-27,DLR
You talked a lot about some of the restructuring efforts that you 're going through How much of these are you actually able to hold onto Are you giving back all this to the customer once you guys reprice this Can you maybe just give me some clarity on that We are seeing margins decline a little bit in {DATE} So I 'm just wondering even longer term how much do you guys try to keep,6,76,1,0.0,0.013157894736842105,0.013157894736842105,0.013157894736842105,0.02631578947368421,2.605373869,29.86,4142.3544,12,0.44348113,1.4220700000000002,2011-Oct-27,EFX

Okay So I guess is that has always been one of the pieces that you could draw on to infuse equity down into the bank to cover losses I am just trying to think through your aggregate capacity is should HELOC losses ultimately be significantly higher and I guess the way to think about this is the {MONEY} {DATE} of excess capital That would be the main draw,4,68,1,0.014705882352941176,0.014705882352941176,0.014705882352941176,0.0,0.029411764705882353,2.88929679,29.86,16902.780880000002,11,0.32437465,1.0858,2011-Oct-27,EQR

Second question from me A lot of discussion on mix internationally Obviously shift towards exploration hopeful Are you seeing a discernible difference in the oil natural gas mix on the exploration side given the tightness in the global gas market,4,40,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.025,4.548975761,25.46,4268.42516,12,0.444241912,5.87386,2011-Oct-28,IPG
I appreciate that John As far as tin plate goes and realizing now that you 're in the process of adjusting for and smoothing out any supply issues that you might have had {DATE} do you anticipate that disruption leads to any volume loss in {DATE} Or do you think your customer relationships remain solid for those customers that were affected,3,61,1,0.0,0.01639344262295082,0.03278688524590164,0.01639344262295082,0.03278688524590164,5.208371006,25.46,19199.40579,5,0.6414830189999999,1.96017,2011-Oct-28,LYB
Keith just to build on your last comment with processors so strong in {CARDINAL} it seems like the margin in the Architecture Software business was the weakest of {DATE} So what was the offset there if overall processors were strong,2,40,1,0.0,0.0,0.025,0.05,0.025,3.651205241,25.46,4027.148,3,0.360139284,1.5171,2011-Oct-28,NWL
Hi thanks for taking the question You guys bought GAC {DATE} for I think it was a pretty good price and so I 'm wondering with {CARDINAL} subs revenues out in the maybe {MONEY} {MONEY} and modest EBITDA would you consider flipping to another format there away from music to something more related to food or shelter,2,57,1,0.0,0.017543859649122806,0.017543859649122806,0.017543859649122806,0.017543859649122806,4.421429742,25.46,8924.66172,11,0.9190466,2.23199,2011-Oct-28,PFG

Thanks good {TIME} A question on the jeanswear coalition The margins were a lot better than we expected especially compared to {DATE} when margins were down {CARDINAL} basis points Can you talk about what drove the up operating margins especially in light of the weaker topline performance compared to,4,49,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04081632653061224,0.04081632653061224,3.5230942080000003,25.46,3505.88076,10,0.5086290170000001,0.24886,2011-Oct-28,UHS
Hello A couple of questions on credit and earnings power On credit if I back out what you provided for in the CFC provision that you did {DATE} which is it fair to say that that 's a catch up provision and you would think that you are done with that Is that a fair assessment,4,56,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.017857142857142856,3.5230942080000003,25.46,3505.88076,10,0.5086290170000001,0.24886,2011-Oct-28,UHS
And last question I guess after this kind of exit from the trading JV your remaining assets are pretty low risk even though you 're out performing {DATE} maybe you 're at {CARDINAL} times {DATE} multiple given the middle of your guidance Whereas peers are maybe {CARDINAL} {CARDINAL} times plus what do you think it takes to close that gap,2,60,1,0.0,0.03333333333333333,0.05,0.0,0.016666666666666666,3.496940631,25.46,4619.84753,2,0.625973918,1.3836700000000002,2011-Oct-28,WHR
Thank you As you look at your own results in {DATE} and particularly on the utilization side can you help us understand maybe what you 're seeing in your own book in terms of what may be more secular impacts in terms of lighter utilization versus it being all just about the economy or maybe to say are you of the view that it is all just about the economy,2,70,1,0.0,0.04285714285714286,0.04285714285714286,0.0,0.0,3.507743451,25.46,3237.5204,11,0.127781054,1.54137,2011-Oct-28,AIV
Been a lot of talk about US merchant {DATE} And with the low operating rates in {DATE} would {CARDINAL} of the opportunities to improve margin and productivity be to shut down some of your oldest least efficient plants to raise margins there,2,42,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07142857142857142,0.023809523809523808,2.71948543,25.46,28601.04758,10,0.347028751,3.32657,2011-Oct-28,BIIB
But in {DATE} we may have something like {PERCENT} organic sales growth so we have price up {PERCENT} and volume down {PERCENT} Is that the right way to think,2,29,1,0.0,0.034482758620689655,0.034482758620689655,0.0,0.0,3.658503584,25.46,8404.8948,2,0.291896858,2.6541200000000003,2011-Oct-28,BWA

Well the first part I think is that your {CARDINAL} largest competitors in North American fracturing seem to be if anything requiring companies to take many of their other product lines if they 're going to give them their frac equipment All the way from requiring to maybe strongly suggesting And I 'm wondering how your strategy in North American pressure pumping compares with that in terms of trying to convince companies to take different Schlumberger product lines along with the frac equipment on new builds,3,86,1,0.011627906976744186,0.011627906976744186,0.023255813953488372,0.0,0.0,2.8488309660000004,25.46,4915.856070000002,11,1.0308193959999998,0.24135,2011-Oct-28,CINF
Okay Ron while I 've got you just you said the number {CARDINAL} priority in retail is to improve the productivity of the retail stores Given that growth in retail is basically flat and because of the structural and secular long term issues that may be the outlook for a long time It seems like a big lever on improving the productivity would be to reduce the size of the stores You 've got {CARDINAL} leases coming due {DATE} Are you still resigning {QUANTITY} store leases for {DATE} and how are you thinking about a smaller store format going forward,6,100,1,0.0,0.01,0.02,0.02,0.01,3.719722213,25.46,5129.38408,3,0.328047081,0.68311,2011-Oct-28,FLS
Just a comment on the long term growth model revenue and earnings growth model if you can Obviously your targets or {PERCENT} revenue growth and {PERCENT} to {PERCENT} earnings growth and I think Ken suggested looking at {DATE} as kind of a base As we look forward to {DATE} and {DATE} it does n't seem like the economic trajectory is going to change all that much from here It certainly does n't feel like it {DATE} But do you feel good about being able to hit those targets You are blowing out your return on equity target pretty significantly but can you hit those the revenue and EPS Do you feel confident in those targets,7,115,1,0.0,0.0,0.008695652173913044,0.02608695652173913,0.0,3.719722213,25.46,5129.38408,3,0.328047081,0.68311,2011-Oct-28,FLS
Okay And then the {MONEY} gain on sale how much of that is related to the decline in the wholesale funding,2,21,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047619047619047616,0.047619047619047616,3.36713913,25.46,5623.02,5,0.321603376,1.69357,2011-Oct-28,EMN
Yes that is helpful And then as we think about {PERCENT} comp for {DATE} and also for {DATE} I mean there is a lot of it sounds like very positive changes taking place Are those more back end loaded or how should we just think about all of the different initiatives in place and the comps you 're guiding to,3,60,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.016666666666666666,0.0,3.422601434,24.53,5446.3288,11,0.343552634,1.87086,2011-Oct-31,UDR
I wanted to ask you on the Beaumont terminals that sounds like that provides a nice ramp in capacity and potential ramp in volumes and I guess a bridge to when you eventually get the Port Arthur that 's obviously going to be a source of bigger volume growth What 's your competitive position look like at the Beaumont terminal Do you expect to capture a large portion of that let 's say it 's a train a day at some point in {DATE} Or is that something where BN and UP are going to get a piece of that business and we should think about it being less than a train a day,5,114,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.008771929824561403,3.422601434,24.53,5446.3288,11,0.343552634,1.87086,2011-Oct-31,UDR
Okay understand thanks for that clarification And the other thing is that you all indicated at the beginning I think that you did sort of that review of your asset base and you see a lot of value creation opportunities Stepping back and looking at the context of that comment is that sort of implying that there 's just a lot of high level development opportunities there or that there 's certainly a lot more monetization efforts that you can undertake as you look into {DATE} and beyond,5,88,1,0.0,0.0,0.011363636363636364,0.022727272727272728,0.0,3.129752594,24.53,16364.52401,11,0.561459861,0.12516,2011-Oct-31,HCP
Okay great And then maybe just {CARDINAL} last one On the investment side again when we think about and there 's been some of this in the press and I realize you 're limited in what you can say but on this next generation Bomber program given you guys teamed up against a formidable other team will we expect a ramp up of internal R&D money on that given the importance of that program potentially to the Company in the future,3,81,1,0.0,0.012345679012345678,0.012345679012345678,0.012345679012345678,0.012345679012345678,2.43046104,29.96,6263.82452,9,0.460982933,0.58877,2011-Nov-01,HSIC
Great And then a follow up in that context With that {PERCENT} growth rate you mentioned you could drill your Northeast gas at the right time So within the context of the pricing expectations and {PERCENT} growth what is the right time for that gas drilling to accelerate,4,48,1,0.0,0.020833333333333332,0.020833333333333332,0.020833333333333332,0.0,2.720211584,29.96,12572.47498,11,0.342432883,0.46664,2011-Nov-01,AVB
Okay And then going on to pricing I think a lot of us and I think you agree that the Affordable Care Act is a big opportunity for you going forward So just a little curious why you 're willing to give up market share now given the level of customer retention ahead of this big opportunity {DATE} and going forward,4,61,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03278688524590164,0.0,2.720211584,29.96,12572.47498,11,0.342432883,0.46664,2011-Nov-01,AVB
This is Patrick O'Brien on for Simeon Just a quick question regarding e commerce Can you give us a sense of what stage of the investment process you are in maybe from perhaps a systems standpoint personnel standpoint Basically how much more groundwork remains for you guys,4,47,1,0.0,0.0425531914893617,0.0425531914893617,0.0,0.02127659574468085,2.720211584,29.96,12572.47498,11,0.342432883,0.46664,2011-Nov-01,AVB
Okay then just {CARDINAL} follow up on the Rite Aid which you talked about a contribution to OneStop Obviously Rite Aid very publicly attributed their improved outlook to their expanded relationship with McKesson Is a proof of concept that we are seeing in Rite Aid starting to resonate with some of your other large retail clients that are not buying the bulk of their generics from you,3,67,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.014925373134328358,0.0,4.696376023,29.96,14074.4718,4,1.488075919,1.23481,2011-Nov-01,VLO

So staying on the Southern Delaware it looks like the wells in {DATE} were fairly spread out throughout your {CARDINAL} areas in the play So I was just curious if the results were consistent throughout all your acreage or was {CARDINAL} area maybe better than others I guess in particular I 'm curious about how South Harpoon performed,3,58,1,0.0,0.017241379310344827,0.017241379310344827,0.017241379310344827,0.0,4.696376023,29.96,14074.4718,4,1.488075919,1.23481,2011-Nov-01,VLO
Okay Great And then on the newer stuff could you explain the importance of the contestability period ending in this calculation or how you see things Why is that so important,4,31,1,0.0,0.03225806451612903,0.03225806451612903,0.03225806451612903,0.0,4.696376023,29.96,14074.4718,4,1.488075919,1.23481,2011-Nov-01,VLO
I guess just {CARDINAL} other questions it 's just kind been out in the market is views on remaining an integrated company with the distribution business on the regulated side and the competitive generation business Can you remind us how you guys think about combined company and what would be required and maybe how you reevaluate that strategy,2,58,1,0.0,0.017241379310344827,0.017241379310344827,0.0,0.017241379310344827,4.696376023,29.96,14074.4718,4,1.488075919,1.23481,2011-Nov-01,VLO
Good {TIME} Just a question on the outlook for operating expenses the {MONEY} When I think about some of the {CARDINAL} time costs that you outlined for BSA ML and EMV it gets the core expense growth rate closer to {PERCENT} So I guess I know we 're still far away from {DATE} but would you expect any of these expenses to stay in the run rate And if not do you think we could resume beyond {DATE} closer to a {PERCENT} expense growth rate,5,85,1,0.0,0.011764705882352941,0.011764705882352941,0.011764705882352941,0.011764705882352941,1.959370202,29.96,17048.9985,8,0.917175556,0.75137,2011-Nov-01,PEG
Thank you Can you talk a little bit about inventory follow up on some of Gary 's questions in the US where your inventory is on a comp store basis relative to where the comp was and what areas you 're investing heaviest in What your relative comfort is in the categories,3,52,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.019230769230769232,1.811847997,29.96,4973.27938,8,1.223660377,3.78667,2011-Nov-01,PNW
So I just want to go back to the sales guidance or sales objectives for Japan for {TIME} because you said that you expect {PERCENT} growth in {DATE} in Japan You are expecting the sale of the {CARDINAL} WAYS to go away basically now that they 've reached the cap in the banks With sales excluding WAYS in {DATE} relatively flat what are you doing to offset what you 're going to see in terms of that huge decline in the sale of WAYS,3,84,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.011904761904761904,1.811847997,29.96,4973.27938,8,1.223660377,3.78667,2011-Nov-01,PNW
Okay Not a problem I realize that was a little bit out of the box {CARDINAL} more though Randy was the takeaway I 'm just going a little fast was the takeaway on the mortality that it was predominantly driven by accidental deaths of people in their {DATE},5,48,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041666666666666664,1.811847997,29.96,4973.27938,8,1.223660377,3.78667,2011-Nov-01,PNW
Well I guess the question is is the inventory I mean overall it looks pretty clean Is it relatively clean also now in women 's apparel as I understand that was the biggest issue And then also part of it was sending the stuff to the Rack So just trying to see whether you 've actually sold it out of the Rack channel as well now and the inventories in the Rack are where they should be,5,77,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.012987012987012988,3.953374352,34.77,4115.25248,12,0.833520547,0.28965,2011-Nov-02,PWR
Yes good {TIME} You have mentioned that you saw some strength of Protiviti in China Japan and Italy and I was wondering if you could expand a little bit on that what is driving that strength,3,36,1,0.0,0.027777777777777776,0.027777777777777776,0.08333333333333333,0.0,3.953374352,34.77,4115.25248,12,0.833520547,0.28965,2011-Nov-02,PWR
Okay And you still talk of {MONEY} in restructuring which really would imply that restructuring would be lower in {DATE} than the second and the third Given the enormity of the credit crisis what is the chance that it could be a bigger number and if not why not,3,49,1,0.0,0.02040816326530612,0.02040816326530612,0.0,0.061224489795918366,2.493674795,34.77,7636.667840000001,8,0.611066494,0.03419,2011-Nov-02,OKE
Sure Hi congratulations on {DATE} I just have a question on Truvada in the U.S. It continues to surprise on the upside and I was just wondering if you could speak to what 's driving this and how long you expect above HIV market growth for the product,4,48,1,0.0,0.020833333333333332,0.020833333333333332,0.0,0.020833333333333332,2.493674795,34.77,7636.667840000001,8,0.611066494,0.03419,2011-Nov-02,OKE
Are you tempted at all to repurchase stock here given your {PERCENT} off from where you issued it in the second step,1,22,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.070968338,34.77,12434.36586,9,0.256038137,0.75063,2011-Nov-02,WFM
As we start cycling some of the commodity deflation lapping at {DATE} what is your outlook for commodities how that is going to be a benefit or hit {DATE},1,29,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.034482758620689655,0.0,2.182321871,34.77,8687.13158,5,0.006109179,3.25133,2011-Nov-02,CLX
I also had a question about the macro hedging As I understand it essentially you are buying S&P puts and selling out of the money S&P calls to fund the puts And I guess the latter part is what concerns me as opposed to just buying the puts directly and eating the costs because frankly it kind of reminds me of what went wrong on the VA product right The customer was being sold way out of the money option that no one ever thought would produce a material loss and it did And it seems like you have done the same thing here You sold way out of the money causing S&P thinking it was a cheap way to finance the puts but they produced a loss again And I guess I was just wondering about the whole risk management changes made at the Company when you are still selling way out of the money calls And can you just tell me A am I understanding correct and B if it is why is that a good idea,8,179,1,0.0,0.0,0.0111731843575419,0.00558659217877095,0.0335195530726257,2.182321871,34.77,8687.13158,5,0.006109179,3.25133,2011-Nov-02,CLX
I know {DATE} kind of always runs into {DATE} anyway because you are trying to close out {DATE} But was there any difference in terms of linearity {DATE},2,28,1,0.03571428571428571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.182321871,34.77,8687.13158,5,0.006109179,3.25133,2011-Nov-02,CLX
Okay and then just finally can you comment on the sequential demand trends I mean it sounded that you were being you were a little bit more optimistic I mean have you seen any sort of a pickup here in the early parts of {DATE} versus what you were seeing during {DATE},4,52,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.019230769230769232,0.0,1.916447785,34.77,16549.89117,10,0.31025946600000004,0.13552999999999998,2011-Nov-02,BDX
And you think you have everything in place right now that you need to be able to get that growth at some point in the near to mid term future,1,30,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03333333333333333,0.0,3.539244736,34.77,2492.56108,9,0.230258918,6.01483,2011-Nov-02,HBI
Good {TIME} guys First Eric I just want to make sure I understand something before I ask the question The outlook for low single digit retail segment growth {DATE} on a comparable basis does that include your direct growth or does that exclude that,3,44,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.022727272727272728,0.022727272727272728,3.539244736,34.77,2492.56108,9,0.230258918,6.01483,2011-Nov-02,HBI

And {CARDINAL} final question on the security business I know the anti denial of service has been getting a bit of attention But could you provide a little more granularity in terms of which services you are seeing the most traction,2,41,1,0.0,0.024390243902439025,0.024390243902439025,0.0,0.04878048780487805,3.0621681780000003,32.74,2239.0434,6,0.662843447,3.5142800000000003,2011-Nov-03,PKI
Okay Thank you Can I ask {CARDINAL} other question on the gross margin Given the recombinant strength in {DATE} I was a little surprised that we did n't see a little bit more upside there Can you just walk through in any granular detail the moving parts there,5,48,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.020833333333333332,0.020833333333333332,2.385717801,32.74,6616.955220000002,6,0.307025837,0.2708,2011-Nov-03,MCHP
Did the overall incremental guidance for {DATE} soften a little bit from {PERCENT} or did I get that did I mishear that,2,22,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.965699774,32.74,12696.256,8,0.84303731,0.37231,2011-Nov-03,SRE
So there 's room And then could you describe Oscar or Fredrik the difference between putting an employee on retention furlough versus putting him on full furlough Is there an economic cost to keeping them sort of ready to jump back into the force if needed quickly,3,47,1,0.0,0.02127659574468085,0.02127659574468085,0.0,0.02127659574468085,3.678903925,32.74,9705.861,6,0.171845742,1.72772,2011-Nov-03,TDC
Okay Going to pricing how much does mix account for in the upside in {DATE},2,15,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.4970627280000002,32.74,16997.37558,8,0.8653720709999999,2.58694,2011-Nov-03,PPL
And with that walk up mix though so much lower than it was {DATE} and generally trending down is that a sign that the full fare hikes that you 've been doing have gone too far,1,36,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.358195398,32.74,25976.28,11,1.141218962,2.89534,2011-Nov-03,PRU
Oh Yes I was wondering about Phoenix It sounded like you had positive comments there and recently added some more inventory Just trying to get a sense of what the demand looks like where the strength is coming from in terms of industry verticals And also what is the sweet spot in terms of size of deployments that you 're seeing demand for there,5,64,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03125,0.0,3.220221372,32.74,5330.33232,7,0.215862585,0.62921,2011-Nov-03,SNI
Marty you referred to strong bookings trends {DATE} in {DATE} Can you quantify what the year over year bookings growth was in both for payroll services business and the HR services business,2,32,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03125,0.0,3.697793178,32.74,7061.15505,11,0.5662345679999999,1.82787,2011-Nov-03,KIM
Just some follow up questions on the expense side I mean I can appreciate the extra regulatory and systems cost But I also recall {DATE} you talked about rationalizing the branch network little bit streamlining some things and basically trying to lower costs even versus that expense level So it 's a question even if you take out the {MONEY} versus the run rate you 're at right now it still feels like the cost might be higher than you {DATE} and if revenue stays sluggish for the industry and for you is there more opportunity or more thought to cut a little bit deeper,5,105,1,0.0,0.009523809523809525,0.009523809523809525,0.009523809523809525,0.05714285714285714,1.994146609,32.74,48104.96257,9,0.8726246540000001,3.63266,2011-Nov-03,CVS
Just wanted to focus a little bit more about the demand in the core market You are seeing consumer financial marketing has had very good growth for {DATE} You guys are working out the concerns that the banks had in terms of using the IXI data or is it really that you are seeing good pick up in the core marketing to consumers within various aspects of the business that 's much more related to what I would say the core business,4,82,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.024390243902439025,0.012195121951219513,1.994146609,32.74,48104.96257,9,0.8726246540000001,3.63266,2011-Nov-03,CVS
And from a capital deployment standpoint Ron I think you have in the past spoken about a {PERCENT} net income payout ratio Is that still the way to think about business And any other capital uses that we should be thinking about,3,42,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.812168794,32.74,9957.96384,4,0.34446261,1.08596,2011-Nov-03,CXO
Right And all incremental Maybe {CARDINAL} more Global markets Dave Cote kind of do not begin to show more signs of life I realize you 're outperforming {DATE} but let 's call it over the course of {DATE} does that cause you to perhaps modify or even accelerate aspects of your operating framework to hit or hopefully exceed your {DATE} targets,4,61,1,0.0,0.03278688524590164,0.03278688524590164,0.01639344262295082,0.0,3.812168794,32.74,9957.96384,4,0.34446261,1.08596,2011-Nov-03,CXO
John should we think of it as super sizing and adding the fries and the Coke and the customers actually wait a little longer to come back Or do they actually consume more,2,33,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.7139961230000003,32.74,6170.3392,7,0.767037904,0.57735,2011-Nov-03,FTR
That 's really helpful And obviously you also spoke about wanting to increase capital in the Anadarko Basin {DATE} I certainly realize that plans are not fully set at this point but I guess is it fair to say that other plays that are largely HBP such as Bakken and Eagle Ford potentially could see increased capital as we increase capital into your higher return plays that are still HBPing like STACK for example,3,74,1,0.0,0.013513513513513514,0.013513513513513514,0.0,0.0,4.009312555,32.74,9660.19306,12,0.299146517,1.7129299999999998,2011-Nov-03,FLR

Makes sense Then a follow up on your Apple Pay commentary When we look at the opportunity outside of the US are there unique hurdles we should consider as we think about the timing of the roll outs in Europe and Asia or is it really just about pulling the partnerships together,3,52,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.019230769230769232,0.0,3.477835277,30.5,3601.5964200000008,1,0.928807239,1.26012,2011-Nov-04,MHK
Thank you Actually Steve hit on exactly what I wanted to go through so I appreciate the color Maybe just to clarify of that {DATE} averaging {PERCENT} Gary you said we should be ending at a {PERCENT} cash tax rate at {DATE} And I apologize can you help me once again why the change in the tax rate Is that simply because with {DATE} of visibility from Enable there 's not enough CapEx to provide a shield,6,77,1,0.0,0.012987012987012988,0.012987012987012988,0.012987012987012988,0.0,3.477835277,30.5,3601.5964200000008,1,0.928807239,1.26012,2011-Nov-04,MHK

Thanks I appreciate the clarification Taking a step back going back to you Investor Day toward {DATE} you had indicated that your longer term {DATE} volume outlook is positive Given the drop off that we have seen in terms of the shale related business some of the coal challenges you indicated as well as uncertainty in terms of the Ag crop do you still have confidence that the volume growth in aggregate will be positive or do you see that a little bit more challenging as we look out from here,3,91,1,0.0,0.0,0.02197802197802198,0.02197802197802198,0.02197802197802198,1.895793655,30.5,7721.2287,8,1.579783959,4.97727,2011-Nov-04,AEE
Very good And then finally to follow up on some of the Hudson City questions If I understand it correctly obviously you guys worked very diligently in updating your systems for the BSA AML issues that were identified It seemed like those were pretty much resolved And then out of left field came another issue on CRA directed if I understand it correctly more at the Hudson City side of the equation If that is correct in what I just said who is responsible for resolving that CRA if there is a issue that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau or whatever agency is addressing it Is it a Hudson city responsibility or is it an M&T responsibility to resolve whatever questions they may come up with,7,126,1,0.0,0.007936507936507936,0.007936507936507936,0.023809523809523808,0.015873015873015872,3.643834941,30.5,19184.21423,4,0.860561263,1.45393,2011-Nov-04,CHK
So as we think about the pace of pricing over {DATE} do you think intermodal price increases will be roughly in line with carload price increases or is there a reason to believe that price increases in {CARDINAL} of these businesses will outpace the other,1,45,1,0.0,0.0,0.044444444444444446,0.0,0.0,2.850043953,30.5,15832.99575,11,0.31842650100000003,0.14612,2011-Nov-04,VTR
Good {TIME} everyone I look forward to working with you Keith are there goals you have that you can point to on the cost side maybe it would be profit per bike or a certain level of SG&A expense that you can point to for investors that are focused on the long term and can get excited about,3,58,1,0.0,0.017241379310344827,0.017241379310344827,0.034482758620689655,0.0,1.4909719069999998,30.16,16399.3034,9,0.266161995,1.53982,2011-Nov-07,SYY
Great okay so in light of the {PERCENT} {PERCENT} we should still be thinking about the back {CARDINAL} better than {DATE} even though you had thought it was going to be flat to down That still holds true that the back {CARDINAL} still presents an opportunity,3,46,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06521739130434782,0.0,3.836192448,29.85,9997.4901,6,0.219973825,6.17018,2011-Nov-08,ROK

And Liberty Mutual {DATE} announced they are buying Safeco do you have a view on whether that is going to give you opportunities in terms of attracting agents or books of business Or do you think that is going to lead to a more competitive environment as both will try and retain the business that they have on the books,2,60,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.016666666666666666,0.0,1.693185016,29.85,15721.5828,6,0.700723443,5.4498,2011-Nov-08,ATVI
{CARDINAL} quick questions for you First on the consumer side can you talk about what the you 're seeing in terms of economics You guys announced a nice wins on the OEM side McAfee some announced nice wins Are we continuing to see the economics of the OEM channel continue to deteriorate or how do you see that playing out over {DATE},4,62,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03225806451612903,2.24404742,29.85,4958.44625,5,0.224142244,2.06387,2011-Nov-08,IFF

The first question is on cash flows You 've shown some pretty impressive cash flows in {DATE} and you 've also talked about your CapEx falling and your demand side actually rising Can you give us some indication for {DATE} what you 'd expect your cash flow generation to be Maybe if you do n't want to give specific guidance if you do make a {MONEY} top line number what it could look like,4,74,1,0.0,0.02702702702702703,0.02702702702702703,0.013513513513513514,0.013513513513513514,3.095366931,31.13,4864.83328,12,0.8362683940000001,0.38806,2011-Nov-15,JEC
Good {TIME} Just a couple of quick questions On the pressure sensitive side you had talked about seeing price increases {DATE} and that they were offset on the volume side Can you give us some color as to what the price increases were and if you expect that to be kind of a sustainable rate going through the rest of {DATE} if you 're starting to see push back on that now,4,72,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.013888888888888888,0.013888888888888888,3.095366931,31.13,4864.83328,12,0.8362683940000001,0.38806,2011-Nov-15,JEC
What 's the profitability of an inactive client that does n't you know does n't use any of your services does n't trade Is there and then will there be a specific action to re engage them,2,37,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02702702702702703,0.0,3.095366931,31.13,4864.83328,12,0.8362683940000001,0.38806,2011-Nov-15,JEC
Okay Second Jim when you think about the environmental regulations especially the HAP or the MACT rules how much flexibility do you think the administration and the EPA has in terms of the timeline of implementation,2,36,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.262839561,31.13,13037.8857,6,0.33877500200000005,3.93282,2011-Nov-15,A
Okay That 's great And Brian last question for you For the first time in {DATE} if I went back and did this correctly in the release you mentioned that relative to your debt obligations you would consider opportunistic opportunities So I was wondering if you could elaborate on that,5,50,1,0.0,0.02,0.02,0.04,0.04,4.262839561,31.13,13037.8857,6,0.33877500200000005,3.93282,2011-Nov-15,A
And how much of that is a focus of your discussion with payers,1,13,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.619393179,31.22,35908.571860000004,9,0.42538802,5.3805,2011-Nov-16,TGT
Got it thanks And just {CARDINAL} more question just switching to air for a moment Obviously a smaller part of the business but just given the difficult trends can you help us think about how that how or if that impacts free cash flow as the year goes on,5,49,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04081632653061224,1.619393179,31.22,35908.571860000004,9,0.42538802,5.3805,2011-Nov-16,TGT
Appreciate the clarification And can you just to the extent help us just decompose the labor deleverage {DATE} Because wage inflation was {DATE} and I know you called out some specifics around both the {TIME} initiative delivery as well as the new stores Is there a way to tease out how much of that is from each of those components and is any how much of it is {CARDINAL} time and contained in {DATE} and how much is it expected to be an ongoing phenomena because those initiatives continue,5,89,1,0.0,0.0,0.011235955056179775,0.0,0.0,2.624008927,31.22,16507.84,3,0.5515254270000001,0.79582,2011-Nov-16,AMAT
Thanks good {TIME} Marc you 'd mentioned some competition coming from some secondary locations Can you just elaborate a little bit further on what those are Is that lower Manhattan or is that other stuff,4,35,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02857142857142857,0.0,2.624008927,31.22,16507.84,3,0.5515254270000001,0.79582,2011-Nov-16,AMAT
Thank you We have one for Philippe and Tom and then one for Philippe For the jump ball you guys are pretty clear about giving us {DATE} guidance on affiliate fee growth of double digits I wonder knowing what you know now about all the deals you have done and looking to {DATE} do you think that double digit run rate continues for {DATE} on domestics ex digital So could you just comment about that for a second,5,78,1,0.0,0.01282051282051282,0.01282051282051282,0.0,0.0,2.624008927,31.22,16507.84,3,0.5515254270000001,0.79582,2011-Nov-16,AMAT
Okay And then Dave do you care to maybe size the level of growth for your hepatitis franchise just to maybe give us some thoughts about how it is growing,2,30,1,0.0,0.06666666666666667,0.06666666666666667,0.0,0.0,2.430048668,33.51,4870.47088,3,0.272789668,4.84812,2011-Nov-17,TDG
Okay And then can you talk about your {PERCENT} growth in revenues that you talked about for {DATE} Are you including anything in that for growth in members in your state your Medicaid contracts that you have existing {DATE} in terms of people who may sign up that perhaps qualified before but have not actually signed up for Medicaid,3,59,1,0.0,0.03389830508474576,0.03389830508474576,0.0,0.0,1.867655303,32.0,5937.0736,1,0.947262009,1.75493,2011-Nov-21,TSN
Can you just talk a little bit about first cat litter and then on the wipes business It seems like cat litter 's starting to turn I 'm wondering what you guys did to get the market share stabilizing again I guess it was pretty competitive for Nestle in that category As you enter {DATE} it was a really elevated cold and flu season and you had a lot of wipes volume What 's the plan to offset that,6,79,1,0.0,0.0,0.012658227848101266,0.012658227848101266,0.0,1.867655303,32.0,5937.0736,1,0.947262009,1.75493,2011-Nov-21,TSN
Good {TIME} guys Question for you regarding the pricing increases that you have been putting through As things have gotten better are you noticing that your pricing power is improving any so that maybe you are able to get not just the offsets to the input costs the higher input cost that you are seeing but potentially just getting any true pricing that is coming through in there,4,68,1,0.0,0.014705882352941176,0.014705882352941176,0.058823529411764705,0.014705882352941176,2.758955723,32.91,3249.41832,9,0.38987163,1.57982,2011-Nov-22,PDCO
And then the other question I had was just on the overall credit rating and the strategy there Fitch has a negative outlook I know that historically you guys have strived to be mid BBB Once you pay down the maturity in {DATE} in your discussions with Fitch and some of the other agencies do you feel like you 'll kind of be affirmed at that mid BBB level at that point,4,72,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.027777777777777776,1.119783267,32.91,10763.6025,1,0.137575643,1.19831,2011-Nov-22,CPB
No doubt no doubt Regarding your agreement with the regulators do you think after you finish all your BSA AML stuff do you think that for you to complete the Hudson City acquisition that that agreement has to be lifted,2,40,1,0.0,0.0,0.05,0.0,0.05,1.119783267,32.91,10763.6025,1,0.137575643,1.19831,2011-Nov-22,CPB
Okay But then {DATE} into {DATE} that should be a nice tailwind maybe {PERCENT} So we should think about maybe the base to grow from {DATE} is {MONEY} as opposed to the {MONEY} because of the {CARDINAL} time large turnaround season,3,41,1,0.0,0.04878048780487805,0.04878048780487805,0.0,0.024390243902439025,2.826133062,27.8,4809.69918,11,0.274552069,2.29857,2011-Dec-01,HRB
Yes no that helps that helps And I guess this is really a {CARDINAL} part question {CARDINAL} more directly with pricing the other somewhat related to pricing If you 're able could you parse out on a rough percentage basis how much of pricing in {DATE} was impacted by geography versus product mix And then finally if you were to look at your markets today versus {DATE} how consolidated are your top markets {DATE} versus {DATE},4,76,1,0.0,0.02631578947368421,0.02631578947368421,0.013157894736842105,0.013157894736842105,2.826133062,27.8,4809.69918,11,0.274552069,2.29857,2011-Dec-01,HRB
Does that mean that you 're displacing the competitors there because they do n't have a new platform out there and or is it grabbing new share And associated with that do you I guess if you 're displacing the competitor what 's the risk as they roll out their own technology platform that it will stall from the pace of growth here I guess that you 're saying,3,69,1,0.0,0.0,0.014492753623188406,0.0,0.028985507246376812,2.728654492,24.29,9186.84996,6,0.161965392,3.28421,2011-Dec-19,RHT

Good {TIME} thank you Just kind of a fine point on the tax rate in health Make sure I understand this If you do n't if you have things that are n't fully deductible does that suggest that in some of {DATE} in the future where earnings may be negative that taxes actually go the other way and the after tax loss will be bigger than the pre tax loss Is that the right way to think about it,5,79,0,0.0,0.02531645569620253,0.02531645569620253,0.012658227848101266,0.0379746835443038,2.117070993,24.92,3978.88044,1,0.552914191,6.03881,2011-Dec-20,CTAS

Just a question on plasmapheresis and whether in suspected cases of PML you are seeing plasmapheresis being used and in those instances whether there is any report of immune reconstitution syndrome Just related to that just wondering if the patient in Europe was plasmapheresed and if there is any issues with immune reconstitution syndrome specifically there,3,56,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03571428571428571,2.784748242,22.2,21030.90525,11,0.96182517,0.26896,2012-Jan-18,STT

Okay And last question A question on special on specialty property You have the loan It 's sub prime You 're insuring it It moves to REO You 're insuring that My understanding is the revenues may change but the profitability is the same does it matter structurally does it matter if there 's a moratorium on foreclosures Because it just remains as a loan being insured as opposed to REO,10,71,0,0.0,0.014084507042253521,0.014084507042253521,0.014084507042253521,0.07042253521126761,2.789645849,19.87,97787.30036,4,0.362133008,0.75594,2012-Jan-20,SLB

Okay thanks A couple more on this release The decision to move {MONEY} as opposed to perhaps the remaining I think there 's an incremental {MONEY} of equity balance in Sand Canyon just could you give us a feel for the thought process on why not just the whole thing or why just this little amount here It 's exactly what you think is going to be the estimateable probable losses at the time,7,74,0,0.0,0.02702702702702703,0.04054054054054054,0.0,0.02702702702702703,2.876101845,18.91,11638.17525,6,0.219973825,1.30608,2012-Jan-25,ROK

No that 's very helpful {CARDINAL} more number Of the {MONEY} {DATE} how much of that do you expect that to be international please,3,24,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.206599403,18.31,4325.9696,12,0.201515537,1.26546,2012-Jan-26,RHI
My first question is on the IT side Obviously it looks that now with the new geographic concentration the fact that you have exited discontinued some of the international technology business is helping to improve the margin So as we think just longer term should we think that this is like a new level of profitability for the IT segment,3,60,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03333333333333333,0.03333333333333333,2.206599403,18.31,4325.9696,12,0.201515537,1.26546,2012-Jan-26,RHI
On the human genomics effort this is obviously a very big project and I 'm just wondering if there will be any interim announceable events we give progress updates on anything that might be coming out of that or is this something that is going to go somewhat radio silent for {DATE} until a drug pops out of this program Or is this something we can expect updates on,3,69,0,0.0,0.028985507246376812,0.028985507246376812,0.014492753623188406,0.0,1.526639069,18.31,17204.631,6,0.499268662,12.98487,2012-Jan-26,RTN
I mean just to summarize so I 'm clear Ultimately the drop in rates is an incremental positive If the macro remains steady then we should think about that as incrementally positive outlook for {DATE} is that fair,3,38,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05263157894736842,0.0,1.682723229,18.31,35989.918,9,0.158114226,0.94282,2012-Jan-26,SBUX

That would be what Ben around what would you say {CARDINAL} basis points or so,1,15,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.547746485,18.31,32282.53468,5,0.212607404,0.47728,2012-Jan-26,CELG

Currenex okay so that was doing well okay I guess because retail FX trading is hot right now Then securities lending spreads down {CARDINAL} bps You expect further spread compression in {DATE} on that book,6,35,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.685154303,18.57,4466.523120000002,12,0.917246649,1.52112,2012-Jan-27,DHI
Okay all right A question on South of Delaware Basin you guys were probably {CARDINAL} of the first movers down there and my question for you is are you testing motion drill {CARDINAL} at a time and how many zones have you tested And the Reeves County play that has its extent into Pecos County and specifically is this an area that had some challenges in terms of drilling Is it a difficult area to drill in And also when could we reasonably expect first production,5,86,0,0.0,0.011627906976744186,0.023255813953488372,0.0,0.046511627906976744,1.599913767,18.53,19475.44291,9,0.362438882,0.54562,2012-Jan-30,MCK

have you typically seen in sort of that type of transfer from maybe a smaller operator to the Atria platform,1,20,0,0.0,0.05,0.05,0.0,0.0,2.466323267,18.53,5111.99826,10,0.976345651,2.89185,2012-Jan-30,HOLX
All right Maybe more simply then is pricing up {DATE} over {DATE} or flat or down,2,16,0,0.0,0.0625,0.0625,0.0,0.0,2.466323267,18.53,5111.99826,10,0.976345651,2.89185,2012-Jan-30,HOLX
My question has to do with competition As you guys look out there right now has competition intensified from what you 've seen {DATE} whether from competitor openings or even from some of your competitors being more promotional,2,38,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02631578947368421,1.390950225,19.4,165884.7479,10,0.620669461,1.78267,2012-Jan-31,PFE
Right So in the event of any monetization then there would be a fairly hefty tax impact Is that a good way of thinking about it,3,26,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.038461538461538464,0.0,2.196572957,19.4,15763.424,2,0.458969567,3.08895,2012-Jan-31,PCAR
Okay And then {CARDINAL} last quick question just on Refrigeration Food The margin has been down in {DATE} here What do you see there for {DATE} I know your volumes maybe returned a little bit in {DATE} What margin are you expecting in that business for {DATE},6,47,0,0.0,0.02127659574468085,0.02127659574468085,0.0,0.02127659574468085,2.196572957,19.4,15763.424,2,0.458969567,3.08895,2012-Jan-31,PCAR
more detail on the commercial side where we 've seen a pick up in restructured loans and has this been a shift in strategy in terms of becoming more aggressive in restructured commercial loans or is this really the lag nature of the CRE loss cycle,1,46,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08695652173913043,2.404900656,19.4,6267.4125,11,0.976991117,2.44354,2012-Jan-31,SLG
Good John When does all of this restructuring end and what does the baseline financial model look like when you 're finished Can you also ensure us that kind of gross margins for example wo n't fall below {PERCENT} And then maybe just separately what else do you need to get comfortable with before increasing the dividend assuming what it looks like no tax relief from the government,4,68,0,0.0,0.014705882352941176,0.029411764705882353,0.014705882352941176,0.014705882352941176,2.846976456,19.4,13590.17156,4,1.829208929,0.19224,2012-Jan-31,VLO
Got it And so too that is a part of the business we could potentially see a little bit of softening as it takes some capacity out down the road,2,30,0,0.0,0.03333333333333333,0.03333333333333333,0.0,0.0,1.422106481,19.4,409771.3519,4,0.476042796,0.11263,2012-Jan-31,XOM

Thanks very much and congrats on the YERVOY launch success I had a couple questions First the YERVOY sales ramp has obviously exceeded expectations and Charlie talked about some of the drivers but I just had a couple of questions about the ramp First of all were there more patients that converted at the time of approval to paying patients than you had expected Second what percentage of the real world dosing is at {CARDINAL} mg rather than the labeled {CARDINAL} mg dosing and third on YERVOY how should we think about {DATE} sales sequentially Should we expect them to be up or down from what you reported in {DATE} And then just to change gears could you just frame for us the disclosure plans on the apixaban data at ESC including whether we should expect a publication {DATE},7,139,0,0.0,0.007194244604316547,0.007194244604316547,0.007194244604316547,0.014388489208633094,1.985208951,19.4,25705.8676,3,0.448651869,0.95298,2012-Jan-31,ITW

solutions business you mentioned varying degrees of price weakness and maybe gave a demand outlook that was n't all that robust I am trying to get a sense within those product lines How much weakness was there and what is the prospect for that continuing,3,45,0,0.0,0.022222222222222223,0.044444444444444446,0.0,0.044444444444444446,1.1818381059999998,19.44,3805.12754,11,0.353011601,2.67904,2012-Feb-01,AJG

The second part was whether it changes over time or whether it should stay constant as the well goes through its life,1,22,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.2093699410000003,19.44,4152.16648,2,1.159392158,0.8807200000000001,2012-Feb-01,WHR
Hey guys let me add my congratulations as well These are obviously tremendous numbers and tremendous guide Dave I wanted to ask you a question Towards the end of your comments you mentioned you see if I 'm correct a mid teens industry growth for the parts and pieces of some of your business that you play in I 'm curious why you do n't think it 's a higher growth sector You just put up tremendous numbers You 're probably solidly in the {PERCENT} plus range for growth teen {DATE} Why is that number not higher,8,97,0,0.0,0.0,0.010309278350515464,0.030927835051546393,0.010309278350515464,1.765770156,19.44,4297.17228,11,1.327288823,1.31118,2012-Feb-01,NDAQ
Just to tie up a loose end with Bob 's question {PERCENT} for {DATE} for Logix would imply high teens for {DATE} is that accurate,2,25,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04,1.6927522309999998,19.44,15832.51,11,0.7000887840000001,0.07607,2012-Feb-01,AET
Is it {PERCENT} would you say,1,6,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.6927522309999998,19.44,15832.51,11,0.7000887840000001,0.07607,2012-Feb-01,AET

just so I understand it I think you 'd said probably {CARDINAL} basis points of the deleverage was on incentive comp So maybe you could just describe the structure of that program a little bit more so we understand how it works And it would be helpful to me obviously an {PERCENT} comp was fantastic But still seems odd that your incentive comp would ramp to such a degree that you 'd delever {CARDINAL} basis points at an {PERCENT} comp So clearly it 's really structured to the upside of the growth So a little bit of help on how it works and how it 's structured I think would help clarify that for me That 's first question And then secondly just on gross margin if you could provide a little bit more clarity on some of the drivers of gross margin What your average price increase was How much was rate versus mix How much was shrink And attachments which I know has been a focus did that contribute to gross margin and was that part of the incentive comp as well,13,184,0,0.005434782608695652,0.016304347826086956,0.02717391304347826,0.005434782608695652,0.005434782608695652,2.234941635,18.55,2822.57664,6,0.8429067579999999,8.083789999999999,2012-Feb-02,PKI
Okay so could n't you just multiply that,1,8,0,0.0,0.125,0.125,0.0,0.0,2.234941635,18.55,2822.57664,6,0.8429067579999999,8.083789999999999,2012-Feb-02,PKI

Good {TIME} I just wanted to touch quickly back on pricing Obviously {DATE} we 've seen some more positive commentary of course on personal lines for obvious reasons But it seems like commercial lines and E&S things have been moving in the right direction Steve I was wondering if you could kind of talk maybe line of business just about where you 're seeing the pockets of strength as opposed to weakness and has the dynamic between new and renewal business changed at all,5,84,0,0.0,0.023809523809523808,0.03571428571428571,0.03571428571428571,0.023809523809523808,1.127190908,18.55,7909.3656,8,0.702348295,0.24875,2012-Feb-02,WEC

But what about share repurchases I think you did {MONEY} going from {MONEY} it was {MONEY} for {DATE} You were at {MONEY} {DATE} I do n't know if the {MONEY} {MONEY} is the new run rate on an {DATE} basis that we can start thinking about As that the way to think about it,5,54,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.095849512,18.55,7917.97032,10,0.148259546,0.20965,2012-Feb-02,VRTX
I guess in terms of the asset sales you all talked about multiple packages in the US It sounds like some of those closed it sounds like PRB is closing maybe {DATE} or something Do you guys have kind of a perceived number to Noble for those asset sales at this point,3,52,0,0.0,0.019230769230769232,0.019230769230769232,0.0,0.038461538461538464,1.47183274,18.55,7200.853920000001,12,0.229092535,2.25621,2012-Feb-02,SRCL
It is Manny here Steve can you provide us an update on leasing at {CARDINAL} Fifth And maybe also comment on whether there has been an increase in competition from {CARDINAL} Fifth that GGP and Thor recently bought,3,38,0,0.0,0.02631578947368421,0.02631578947368421,0.0,0.0,1.47183274,18.55,7200.853920000001,12,0.229092535,2.25621,2012-Feb-02,SRCL

And then lastly just on the international ICD market is it correct if I exclude out the impact from the JLL distributor that your base CRM business would have grown closer to {PERCENT} constant currency international Just want to make sure that that number is right,2,46,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.802576349,18.55,3319.522560000001,3,0.556092856,3.84116,2012-Feb-02,SNA

Okay And just on the CE mark approval for Promus element and TAXUS element I know you 're not disclosing much on your regulatory strategy there but the clinical data that you 're going to use to file have you disclosed or will you disclose what you 're going to be or if any clinical data that you 're going to be using to file there to help us understand that time line a little bit better,2,77,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.012987012987012988,0.03896103896103896,2.636653941,17.98,8382.60785,11,1.298814914,1.94906,2012-Feb-03,PFG
Okay And so I guess for those of us who think unemployment may go higher is there any way to think about what sensitivity the benefit ratio or guidance would have if we were talking {PERCENT} unemployment,2,37,0,0.0,0.02702702702702703,0.02702702702702703,0.02702702702702703,0.05405405405405406,2.121571411,17.98,10803.3981,11,0.434945199,4.13937,2012-Feb-03,WY

Hi guys Staying with the FIF for {TIME} If you look at the loan balances there they have been coming down {PERCENT} a quarter Where do you expect the loan balance to be relative to the {MONEY} that was modeled when you announced it in {DATE},4,46,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.191796461,17.98,5574.97696,1,0.947262009,1.5628,2012-Feb-03,TSN
Okay And then I guess the last question I 've got for you you said your margin in {DATE} was {PERCENT} Is that a good run rate going forward or with the deposit costs coming down a little bit more do you think you 'll actually do a little better and what does that mean for the {CARDINAL} basis points guidance for {DATE},4,63,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.031746031746031744,0.015873015873015872,1.191796461,17.98,5574.97696,1,0.947262009,1.5628,2012-Feb-03,TSN

Jim first on the merger I just noticed that you mentioned that you 've restarted the integration process So I guess my question is does that mean it 's stopped and when was that and what changed and can you just provide some color on what you 're referring to,5,50,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04,1.979621951,17.76,3910.74926,12,0.473112374,0.18254,2012-Feb-07,MLM

Thank you again for letting me ask a follow up George you began the call just speaking to the new hires and I was just wondering if we should think about growth within each of these new areas Organic growth Or do you think there are certain technologies out there that you need to bring in house to accelerate your efforts in these areas,4,64,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.650807647,17.76,5436.31136,3,0.272789668,1.7477599999999998,2012-Feb-07,TDG
I meant with you Is it likely that something could actually structurally happen over {DATE} Or is it something where there 's still a lot of work to do to get something done,3,33,0,0.0,0.030303030303030304,0.030303030303030304,0.0,0.0,1.650807647,17.76,5436.31136,3,0.272789668,1.7477599999999998,2012-Feb-07,TDG
Great And when we think about the {DATE} exploration program and the deep GOM and obviously it 's a little ways out but have you identified which prospects are under consideration,2,31,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03225806451612903,0.0,1.43249661,17.76,4827.8784,11,0.969016727,0.80189,2012-Feb-07,TMK
Thank you On the {DATE} guidance is that likely to be impacted by the pending purchase of the animal health products and more generally what is the landscape looking like for Lilly in terms of additional acquisitions either in animal health or other areas that might provide you with a greater level of diversification And then on solanezumab can you narrow down the timing of when we will likely see results and also where you are with the interim looks and whether you will announce {CARDINAL} of those well once those interim looks have been completed,3,96,0,0.0,0.010416666666666666,0.020833333333333332,0.010416666666666666,0.0,1.43249661,17.76,4827.8784,11,0.969016727,0.80189,2012-Feb-07,TMK

{DATE} Okay And then so I guess the capital position to be fair going forward that {CARDINAL} could potentially shrink if we continue to see what we have been seeing through {DATE},3,32,0,0.0,0.03125,0.03125,0.0,0.0,1.089278981,17.76,29098.74224,9,0.068816634,0.66862,2012-Feb-07,YUM

Philip you said at the start of the call that you believe we are getting closer to finding an acquisition Is that just because of the passing of time or is anything tangible which prompts that statement,2,37,0,0.0,0.0,0.02702702702702703,0.0,0.0,1.66569055,17.65,13669.5446,9,0.256038137,3.62327,2012-Feb-08,WFM

Okay Thanks and one on programming I think your investment in programming has differentiated you from peers and so within the outlook are we now at a point where that {CARDINAL} original hours is that going to be maybe stable going forward Maybe more broadly are you finding it harder or more expensive to launch a successful show versus a {DATE} or two ago,3,64,0,0.0,0.03125,0.03125,0.03125,0.0,1.708238497,18.16,5557.0233,7,0.266832245,0.5198699999999999,2012-Feb-09,SNI

Good {TIME} {CARDINAL} questions please Firstly on palbociclib you mentioned the recurrent breast cancer trial you 're running Just to understand the trial design are you looking at adding the drug on top of Afinitol or looking at it in a head to head design Second are you looking at the development of palbociclib with concomitant chemotherapy in select hemotypes using the drug as a chemoprotectant which as an idea has been suggested by some And then finally on Xeljanz could you just outline the rapporteur and co rapporteur whether the possibility exists for seeking individual rather than central approval if you do in fact perceive the rejection from your ongoing appeal,7,112,0,0.0,0.008928571428571428,0.026785714285714284,0.008928571428571428,0.017857142857142856,2.2304185000000003,18.16,28453.8,11,1.580033941,1.88657,2012-Feb-09,PRU

Just to follow up on the {MONEY} of excess capital could we assume that would come ratably over {DATE} meaning {MONEY} per quarter or would it be more back end loaded,1,31,0,0.0,0.03225806451612903,0.06451612903225806,0.0,0.0,1.333835849,18.63,9128.101,10,0.357546136,1.27676,2012-Feb-10,LH

Looking at your numbers your sales growth was {PERCENT} and your food inflation was {CARDINAL} so it 's clear that any real volume growth was on the minimal side But I 'm just wondering if you have a sense for how much I assume that your industry in general is probably down from {DATE} in real terms but I wonder if you have a sense for how much the restaurant and foodservice industry in general how it might be comparing with {DATE} results,2,83,0,0.0,0.012048192771084338,0.03614457831325301,0.0,0.0,3.315159032,20.79,9368.80032,10,0.094426632,0.41201,2012-Feb-13,REGN

If I look at your {PERCENT} organic growth rate contribution for {DATE} definitely better than I thought Is this something that you see as sustainable as you progress through {DATE} and what do you think would be the risks to this particular growth rate if there were any,2,48,0,0.020833333333333332,0.0,0.020833333333333332,0.041666666666666664,0.0,1.284220689,19.04,17349.468,11,0.34629922,0.53646,2012-Feb-14,MMC
The question is about switching I want to focus on this because it is {PERCENT} of your revenues and it 's showing momentum And the first question is what is driving the momentum Then Charlie {DATE} alluded to a new platform coming on the switching side on the conference call Do you expect to have a product cycle in this space And I see that the growth is both modular as well as stackable So the question is what is going to happen once you introduce a new product Do you think there 's going to be a product cycle upgrade or a product upgrade as much as you had on the routing side,8,114,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02631578947368421,1.507246586,19.04,13247.46948,12,0.358700222,0.4380600000000001,2012-Feb-14,OMC

Actually a question related to last sentence you just said In the U.S. the year to date comp has been up and price as you stated previously is running up {CARDINAL} and traffic from what I understand is {DATE} of the comp So could you comment on negative mix that you 've seen in the U.S. in {DATE} And I guess more importantly as we move forward whether things like beverages change in the {MONEY} menu and even lower gas prices at the consumer level may actually create a positive environment for you as we move forward,4,97,0,0.0,0.020618556701030927,0.020618556701030927,0.010309278350515464,0.020618556701030927,2.563093598,18.19,5686.7655,4,0.95854408,0.82975,2012-Feb-22,NFX

Understanding that {DATE} had some unique attributes did you see any signals in {DATE} that would suggest that you saw stability in any end markets or any particular verticals and maybe talk a little bit about what the assumptions are underpinning the guide for the with respect to any kind of improvement and then I guess more longer term as we think about recovery scenario where would you expect to see the first signs of reacceleration across your product lines,2,80,0,0.0,0.025,0.0375,0.025,0.0,2.793140324,18.19,16231.12892,4,1.159860151,0.21197,2012-Feb-22,CHK
Hi Thanks very much My question is about Skype Is {PERCENT} of the Skype revenue going to be in the E&D segment And if it is it looks like the revenue and earnings contribution or OpEx contribution is a little bit lower than what I would have expected Are there any write downs or any shifts or any transitional issues that we should be thinking about in terms of the run rate for Skype relative to what it was historically,6,80,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0125,2.793140324,18.19,16231.12892,4,1.159860151,0.21197,2012-Feb-22,CHK

Well let me press you on that While you do n't want to go back and look at the numbers mid single digit pricing just your gut does that compare with double digit pricing {DATE} or upper single digit pricing sorry in {DATE},2,43,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.436270091,18.19,17269.7423,8,0.176942447,0.8842899999999999,2012-Feb-23,WMB

In the low end did your business in aggregate grow in the low end I 'm sure you had cannibalization of the new products replacing the old products and you said the {CARDINAL} and {DATE} were good but in aggregate did the low end products grow,2,46,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.021739130434782608,0.0,0.997125599,18.19,35574.49309,9,0.500253225,1.38676,2012-Feb-23,TGT

With the auto business the Chrysler business you mentioned can we assume everything sort of walks out the door on {DATE} or walked out the door on {DATE} or did you already see some of the business leaving impact your numbers in {DATE},1,43,0,0.0,0.0,0.023255813953488372,0.0,0.0,2.1383475730000003,16.8,4401.64765,1,0.91616633,0.14605,2012-Feb-24,MHK

{CARDINAL} questions How are you doing The first question was I do n't know if you have any feel if you could give us any thoughts on you talked about a bit of a deceleration in the same client transaction growth in North America during {DATE} I 'm just curious if you have any insight as to whether that was more around your consumer focus cards or versus commercial Any thoughts or insight there,5,74,0,0.0,0.013513513513513514,0.013513513513513514,0.0,0.02702702702702703,1.04943478,18.19,13885.5201,8,0.8669772309999999,4.75851,2012-Feb-28,SRE
Is it fair to say that the North America margins that have been kind of in the {DATE} kind of {PERCENT} {PERCENT} are they bias down over {DATE} now just given the pricing concession and then some cost to ramp the BofA contract,1,43,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.428356606,18.19,3922.65164,10,0.66753834,0.33385,2012-Feb-28,UHS

And then my understanding was that you had to accrue as if you already owned {PERCENT} of these boutiques under the statutory accounting regime So {CARDINAL} am I right and if I am would that suggest that when you do buy into additional stakes it actually does n't really impact your RBC ratio at all,3,55,0,0.0,0.01818181818181818,0.01818181818181818,0.0,0.0,1.179177622,17.96,7888.279159999999,8,0.941070348,4.1830300000000005,2012-Feb-29,CNP

Got it Okay Thanks And then I guess is it fair to say then that you 're testing different plays from the Sanish and {CARDINAL} Forks that others are testing or that that concept is different or can add a little bit more color to what you are doing differently than others,4,52,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.338881602,17.26,4464.3391200000015,9,0.531609715,2.3395900000000003,2012-Mar-02,FL

A little bit more on {DATE} stage delinquencies are looking good but the outlook is still negative for {DATE} The first question is what 's the severity on these lines In other words even if delinquencies were to stabilize would worse severity mean higher loan losses in the future That 's kind of {CARDINAL} Number {CARDINAL} Joe can you elaborate on what you mean by the seasonal impact on delinquencies I guess Number {CARDINAL} I guess you 're assuming {PERCENT} unemployment where as our economist here is expected {PERCENT} unemployment So what would be the impact if we got to that higher unemployment level,8,104,0,0.0,0.0,0.009615384615384616,0.019230769230769232,0.11538461538461539,1.439881814,15.58,16885.9593,11,0.6543122720000001,3.59792,2012-Mar-21,DFS
I have questions on guidance In the press release you talked about the gross cost savings from Wyeth being {MONEY} which has always been the number But you 're also talking about after reinvesting that translates into net savings of {MONEY} Maybe I have missed it in the past but I do n't recall hearing that gross versus net distinction And I am wondering if in essence you are saying you 're going to cut less cost out of Wyeth than what you originally said {DATE} Another question is on your revenue guidance for {DATE} how are you accounting for pipeline products that could launch between now and then So you 've got certain products like Prevnar in adults for example and Dimebon are those types of products in that revenue guidance Then the last piece is just on the R&D. So you put forth some pretty aggressive R&D cost cutting figures for {DATE} and {DATE} As I think kind of the core of the organization how are you confident that that is n't going to ultimately come around to bite you for potentially under investing in R&D,10,188,0,0.005319148936170213,0.010638297872340425,0.010638297872340425,0.010638297872340425,0.026595744680851064,3.303989625,15.13,8647.356,6,1.458774159,1.19488,2012-Mar-22,MU

Right And also just to clarify that point as far as I can tell you wo n't have much clarity or at least from what we 've gathered on Unit {CARDINAL} by {DATE} have n't heard anything at all to suggest that that is reaching a conclusion on a Confirmatory Action Letter or what have you So just to be clear assuming that you get this Unit {CARDINAL} restarted is the likelihood if I 'm hearing you right that Unit {CARDINAL} most likely gets retired Or what would have happened by {DATE} to give you comfort or clarity on Unit {CARDINAL},4,101,0,0.0,0.009900990099009901,0.0297029702970297,0.0,0.0,1.45453203,16.44,7912.38312,9,0.383501265,0.81433,2012-Apr-05,KMX
And then just a quick one is pricing stable there,1,10,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1,0.0,1.64450391,17.2,171170.4224,11,1.401229524,1.33012,2012-Apr-13,JPM
Just wanted to clarify that Last thing is I just noticed a slight you talked about Airborne and some delays in orders and you also mentioned that there 's {PERCENT} margin dilution from the acquisitions this compares to I think {PERCENT} {DATE} when you spoke about it Could you talk a little bit about both the sales and the margin contribution from the recent acquisitions in the extent to which these are meeting your plan,4,75,0,0.0,0.013333333333333334,0.013333333333333334,0.0,0.013333333333333334,1.64450391,17.2,171170.4224,11,1.401229524,1.33012,2012-Apr-13,JPM
And your statement about pricing {DATE} of relatively confident as well that applies to Europe as well,1,17,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058823529411764705,0.0,1.32463782,19.55,11131.484,11,0.744610752,0.74142,2012-Apr-17,NTRS
Okay That 's helpful And then just on the buyback potential the immediacy of that is that something that can possibly happen {DATE} or are we thinking more about a {DATE} and beyond type of event,3,36,0,0.0,0.027777777777777776,0.027777777777777776,0.0,0.0,1.060539724,19.55,20679.75936,10,0.429472568,0.0,2012-Apr-17,SYK
Got it Okay that was my first question and actually you answered my other question related to high net worth on where the limits tend to kick in The second question I had again in your opening remarks Steve you mentioned the Cincinnati Re and I think you said {MONEY} of premium was that right or,4,56,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05357142857142857,1.1002835009999998,19.55,13419.27795,12,0.358700222,1.5187700000000002,2012-Apr-17,OMC
But can you reconcile {QUANTITY} a day of ethane rejection versus the {QUANTITY} a day reduction in NGLs distributed from {DATE},1,21,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047619047619047616,1.1002835009999998,19.55,13419.27795,12,0.358700222,1.5187700000000002,2012-Apr-17,OMC
Thanks Going back to commercial real estate and taking a little longer view for {DATE} people were more concerned about deterioration in CRE over {DATE} Do you believe in the concept or the likelihood that commercial real estate even though your portfolio 's performing very well right now could start to see deterioration over {DATE} as vacancies continue to increase rent rolls fall and if not for yourself do you believe it may happen for the industry,3,77,0,0.0,0.025974025974025976,0.06493506493506493,0.0,0.03896103896103896,1.1002835009999998,19.55,13419.27795,12,0.358700222,1.5187700000000002,2012-Apr-17,OMC
And a quick follow up there is on the rent side it looks like rent per square foot was actually down {DATE} maybe I 'm calculating that wrong but is that also something that should continue going forward,1,38,0,0.0,0.02631578947368421,0.02631578947368421,0.0,0.02631578947368421,1.35368162,19.55,21482.35637,10,0.145392251,2.29371,2012-Apr-17,ISRG
Got it thanks And then on the restructuring and the productivity savings I think you pushed up by {MONEY} the kind of productivity savings you expect to get {DATE} Does that reflect any kind of acceleration in restructuring spend or you 're just getting a better payback on the plans that you had outlined at {DATE},4,56,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.017857142857142856,0.03571428571428571,1.752784703,18.46,7607.3946,6,0.081927775,1.06101,2012-Apr-18,LLTC
Okay And then as you look out to the rest of {DATE} your expectations are obviously buoyed by the group bookings What percentage of those group bookings have contracted minimum room usage and food and beverage spent,3,37,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.760617105,18.46,5123.9745,3,0.451354121,2.46481,2012-Apr-18,LRCX
Thank you So should we expect the OKS {MONEY} to decline in {DATE} as these projects start to near completion,2,20,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05,2.5966605680000003,18.46,2608.87161,12,0.308388672,3.3462400000000003,2012-Apr-18,URI
Last one,1,2,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.895595993,18.46,28674.0734,11,1.387483583,0.15750999999999998,2012-Apr-18,BK
Can you put a number in terms of either RBC ratio points or the change in required capital from the {CARDINAL} on Takafuji,1,23,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.320888312,18.46,28191.84795,11,0.95560993,1.48005,2012-Apr-18,BLK
Is there anything remaining that needs to be taken down for maintenance purposes in {DATE},1,15,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.320888312,18.46,28191.84795,11,0.95560993,1.48005,2012-Apr-18,BLK
Okay so then I guess a follow up question is can those air permits be amended to increase those capacity factors,1,21,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047619047619047616,2.027020384,18.46,23317.1796,12,0.726672141,3.688930000000001,2012-Apr-18,CSX
So that means there was a {MONEY} gain from OpEx that offset the {MONEY} part of the {MONEY} revenue,1,19,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05263157894736842,0.0,1.905134283,18.46,5490.68625,11,1.060312662,4.10419,2012-Apr-18,HBAN
Good {TIME} A couple of quick questions The new fracs that are coming up in Mont Belvieu does this level of ethane rejection change the ramp up schedule or the ramp up schedule still remains or likely be the same,3,40,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.025,0.05,1.395903731,18.46,9584.54246,10,0.424186831,1.62142,2012-Apr-18,DGX
I guess maybe asking my question in another way When you all gave guidance for that level to be in low {DATE} it was under the old efficiency calculation Given that the new calculation is beneficial by a couple {CARDINAL} basis points is it possible to get into {DATE} now that you 're using the new methodology,3,57,0,0.0,0.03508771929824561,0.03508771929824561,0.03508771929824561,0.017543859649122806,1.342680361,18.46,11475.57045,3,0.50121879,0.93925,2012-Apr-18,DOV
In your prepared remarks you mentioned a number of floor sweeps which would suggest that customers are doing some upgrades Is there any potential that the top {CARDINAL} could be closer to flat {DATE} or you still think that the top {CARDINAL} would decline in {DATE},2,46,0,0.0,0.043478260869565216,0.043478260869565216,0.0,0.021739130434782608,0.991625045,18.64,37836.78429,6,0.522545747,1.85595,2012-Apr-19,DHR
I can concur I have seen how you guys operate The other question and I know you went through a couple items like the {DATE} policy issue and whatnot it just seems to me that compared to there is a sea change in the growth outlook particularly you see it on the new business premium You are just walking away from new business it looks like as far as I can tell Is there anything in {DATE} that is dramatically different from your market outlook {DATE} that is causing you to put on the brakes,7,95,0,0.0,0.0,0.010526315789473684,0.0,0.010526315789473684,1.401748461,18.64,13379.0458,3,0.638937266,0.5381100000000001,2012-Apr-19,NUE

Just in terms of the absolute level of cost looking from {DATE} on is this a good level for absolute level of cost an the expense site or do you see more opportunities for potentially cutting costs in {DATE},1,39,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05128205128205128,0.0,1.4415720580000002,18.64,52494.60855,12,0.608648638,2.75953,2012-Apr-19,UNP

Okay And any way of sort of thinking about the quantification of that I suppose the older business will over time just be muted further by new business growth correct,3,30,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.720249746,18.64,5815.01475,5,0.364752423,1.52631,2012-Apr-19,ALB
Thank you very much Let me just ask about inventories There 's a lot of talk Paul about double ordering in the channel Let me just ask you your in house inventory is well below your historical levels Is this a new normal given reduced cycle times or should we expect a rebuild through the rest of into first half of {DATE} And related to that can you just also talk about what you 're seeing in terms of corporate spending was there a little bit of corporate spending embedded in guidance or should we expect more from corporate in {DATE},6,101,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.846213256,18.64,31476.7686,11,1.525153363,2.16793,2012-Apr-19,COF

And I guess Jim if you could just talk to just for calibration 's sake what your earned ROEs are expected to be at APS in {DATE} on the current guidance range,1,32,0,0.0,0.03125,0.03125,0.0,0.0,1.032515541,18.64,10055.0826,9,0.292177346,2.48325,2012-Apr-19,GPC
On the joint venture I just want to understand the premium the sale to JPMorgan is based on a fixed premium based on a book value of the assets And so with the loss that you guys incurred specifically in the crude line it 's {MONEY} but is there any significant sort of impairment to that book value,2,58,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.034482758620689655,1.032515541,18.64,10055.0826,9,0.292177346,2.48325,2012-Apr-19,GPC
Thanks and just as a quick reminder you 're not outlaying any capital for these projects materially so to speak This is all paid for by the mines and the importers themselves correct,2,33,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.652866001,18.64,13027.99296,11,1.094282212,0.2059,2012-Apr-19,FITB
Okay great And I guess {DATE} you guys had said that you thought EPS would be {PERCENT} in {DATE} Is that still a good number to work off of,4,29,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06896551724137931,0.0,2.041084982,18.64,36312.66611000001,12,0.541819633,1.45625,2012-Apr-19,FCX
Okay And then the second question is do you have for {DATE} the LCD price declines in SCP and the wholly consolidated business,2,23,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08695652173913043,1.519655472,18.36,93158.4304,4,0.362133008,0.51561,2012-Apr-20,SLB
On your {DATE} guidance you said revenues and earnings were lowered primarily due to FX Were there any other contributing factors Then second Lilly 's call was dominated by questions about solanezumab in Europe the product bapineuzumab is going to have important data in {DATE} as well yet you never seem to talk about it too much I 'm hoping I can ask you a few questions on this The first is what would be the timing and venue for seeing the results of the {CARDINAL} US trials The second is can you confirm that you 'll likely present the results for both trials at the same time like Lilly will do And then the third point have there been futility analyses done with bapineuzumab of these {CARDINAL} trials,7,129,0,0.007751937984496124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.015503875968992248,0.52898275,18.36,29606.85234,3,0.196923892,3.14083,2012-Apr-20,KMB

Great Thank you for that And I guess following up wondering in terms of the land investments you talked about margins likely to be up over {DATE} and room for improvement there Wondering in terms of the underwriting in terms of new land investment Presumably the underwriting margins are current margins Is that correct,6,54,0,0.0,0.0,0.018518518518518517,0.037037037037037035,0.0,2.479296024,17.44,3784.04312,11,1.537085312,0.66951,2012-Apr-23,ZION
And Jim just on the refinery- how should we think about the impact of Flanagan South and the Canadian crude on your refinery margins,1,24,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.16144404,17.44,9509.07902,6,0.437903787,2.37169,2012-Apr-23,ROP
So having said all that I think that this management team has done a good job around making acquisitions and laying out the prospects for example around OTN so what 's holding you back right now John You have a great balance sheet you 've got lots of cash Is it the price of the assets in the marketplace or something that you think would fit in is n't currently available in the marketplace How would you characterize it,4,79,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02531645569620253,0.0,1.16144404,17.44,9509.07902,6,0.437903787,2.37169,2012-Apr-23,ROP
Okay If it is {PERCENT} of assets under custody should we assume that servicing revenues will go up {PERCENT} Or is there a multiplier effect,3,25,0,0.0,0.0,0.04,0.0,0.0,2.348108308,17.44,4873.3837,12,0.917246649,4.60688,2012-Apr-23,DHI
Great if I could follow up on item number {CARDINAL} on the rate The spread if I sort of change your words around it sounds like you 're beginning to compare more favorably as others take or maybe even need to take rate actions that are greater than yours which is bringing either pricing further together or making them even more expensive than your own Is that roughly the right take away of what you were saying,3,77,0,0.0,0.025974025974025976,0.03896103896103896,0.03896103896103896,0.0,5.111482872,17.44,5476.15328,6,0.289048707,2.4761,2012-Apr-23,ILMN
Good {TIME} On the US ethane price situation do you see those lower prices immediately or is there some sort of lag given your inventory situation,3,26,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.038461538461538464,0.038461538461538464,1.447082525,18.97,14963.565,2,0.458969567,1.83175,2012-Apr-24,PCAR
Okay and then just {CARDINAL} quick follow up You guys in {DATE} there was a DISA contract announced {MONEY} over {DATE} Is that installed now Should we start to see that flow into {DATE} revenues,4,35,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.447082525,18.97,14963.565,2,0.458969567,1.83175,2012-Apr-24,PCAR
Okay Just what has changed versus {DATE} When I just look at this disclosure it seems like there is a significant improvement relative to what it was {DATE} Is it that you are making more conservative up front assumptions on recoveries or is it that recovery rates have actually improved,3,50,0,0.0,0.0,0.04,0.04,0.0,0.831767542,18.97,23864.79956,1,0.28336148,1.46118,2012-Apr-24,RAI^G17
Got it that 's helpful thanks David When you look at ShareFile and storage help us understand there 's a part of it that 's SaaS.

Okay understood Just as a follow up you laid out shared services which was helpful Presuming that you did have a complete exit for merchant generation should we assume that that {MONEY} would not effectively be transferred back to the parent but would effectively no longer be an expense for the parent because those services are truly allocated and dedicated to the merchant business,3,64,0,0.0,0.0,0.03125,0.0,0.0,1.008031244,18.1,4874.235220000001,11,0.969016727,0.41272,2012-Apr-25,TMK

Good {TIME} Jeff Question for you on the gas volumes which were fairly weak I think you pointed out in the press release {QUANTITY} down {DATE} Could you highlight the Netherlands component of that and maybe give us an update of for one what contribution the Netherlands had in that decline and maybe some timing or outlook on when that may come back,4,63,0,0.0,0.06349206349206349,0.06349206349206349,0.015873015873015872,0.047619047619047616,1.003421407,16.82,7977.86132,11,0.273399697,0.1625,2012-Apr-26,DLR

Okay Finally last one from me I was trying to do some rough math on the earnings guidance for {DATE} folks And taking into consideration the factors cited the change in the downstream situation little higher exploratory expense the lift the anticipated level of lifting increase I ca n't make the math work {CARDINAL} seems well too low unless my unit profitability assumptions on the incremental volumes are way too high Any thoughts you can offer and in particular tell me what kind of price realization underlies that forecast,6,89,0,0.0,0.0,0.033707865168539325,0.011235955056179775,0.0,3.16598338,16.82,3328.6896,12,0.802986344,0.12896,2012-Apr-26,PHM

I guess to follow up on the question that Roger asked on the provisioning to be blunt I do n't fully understand because I see you overprovided even though the chargeoffs in home equity have sort of continued down on a trend downward So I guess would you expect chargeoffs late on because these modifications to increase,3,57,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08771929824561403,1.567289593,16.82,4956.30432,12,0.512205522,0.28915,2012-Apr-26,IPG

So thinking about that potentially for {DATE} there could be some benefit as we start to lap this in {DATE} if there is something in the micro merchandising initiative that we 're looking for on the gross margin line,1,39,0,0.0,0.02564102564102564,0.02564102564102564,0.02564102564102564,0.0,2.4607230980000003,16.82,4779.87094,6,0.480686649,3.71422,2012-Apr-26,SWKS
Hi good {TIME} everybody Congrats on the results Question to do with customer behavior What are you seeing around advanced platform adoption and some of the higher price SKUs out there Are you seeing customers stay with the lower price SKUs or are you seeing sort of change in behavior given the macro backdrop,5,54,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.018518518518518517,0.018518518518518517,1.910026156,16.24,38783.62033,11,1.97750034,1.14641,2012-Apr-27,MET
Right But then to Chris point it looks like you 'll end up cutting more outside contractors than the {CARDINAL} or than the {DATE} to {CARDINAL} you just mentioned,2,29,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.551862116,16.24,23396.95962,12,0.506693363,0.27083,2012-Apr-27,NEM

And staying on the mom and pop theme there Mike when you think about the appetite for new space on the part of mom and pop retailers now versus perhaps {DATE} how would you gauge the difference in their perception and their desire to increase their footprint,1,47,0,0.0,0.02127659574468085,0.02127659574468085,0.0,0.0,1.493289929,16.24,3884.82105,10,0.66753834,1.06241,2012-Apr-27,UHS
Okay a couple of other quick questions Do you have the gas capacity factors from the old DENA assets for {DATE} and maybe what they had been in {DATE},2,29,0,0.0,0.034482758620689655,0.034482758620689655,0.0,0.034482758620689655,1.493289929,16.24,3884.82105,10,0.66753834,1.06241,2012-Apr-27,UHS
No problem The other thing is with RFID growth moderating in {DATE} do you think it can actually turn negative in {DATE},2,22,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09090909090909091,0.80752763,16.24,9612.86997,8,1.10574585,1.71351,2012-Apr-27,DTE
Yes I was really thinking if I look back {DATE} now we were looking for I think way back for a judgment {DATE} Do you have any sense for when this might finalize,2,33,0,0.0,0.030303030303030304,0.030303030303030304,0.0,0.0,0.80752763,16.24,9612.86997,8,1.10574585,1.71351,2012-Apr-27,DTE

Are there substantial supply chain differences down the fragrance customer applications versus the food one So that you would n't expect inventory effects in flavors that you are seeing over in the fragrance side,2,34,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.115380598,16.32,22407.86025,9,0.335451216,1.39505,2012-Apr-30,MCK
LAUGHTER And then just the last question is do you have any comments on like on EPS cadence of EPS consensus of EPS throughout {DATE} Obviously the growth rate is not totally even Just wondering if you had any thoughts,4,40,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.025,1.115380598,16.32,22407.86025,9,0.335451216,1.39505,2012-Apr-30,MCK
Hi good {TIME} Thank you John I was interested in your comments {CARDINAL} of the normalized earnings {CARDINAL} of the normalized earnings of the businesses were generating sort of record results {DATE} And it got me to thinking about your longer term ROE And obviously there is a lot of market dynamics in effect here but I guess the way I would ask the question is as you look at the businesses that are actually underperforming has there been anything that you would characterize as you have reviewed those businesses as sort of permanent return reduction in terms of the potential returns for those businesses i.e. annuities or asset management as you look out And if so what kind of overall impact do you think that has on your franchise ROE objectives,6,132,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.007575757575757576,0.015151515151515152,2.218627863,17.15,13647.4169,4,1.829208929,0.7350800000000001,2012-May-01,VLO
First of all congratulations on the closure of your Wyeth transaction I think it is fair to say that {DATE} you will have more product news from your pipeline than you have had for quite some time I wondered in that vein if you could just give us a little bit of insight on {CARDINAL} projects {CARDINAL} I wanted to know what the earliest might be that we will see the Prevnar data in adults because I think that the timing for the submission of that was {DATE} Secondly if you know any more on the IGF program if you could give us an update there And then when might we start seeing a Phase {CARDINAL} program for Tanezumab report out {DATE},6,122,0,0.0,0.03278688524590164,0.03278688524590164,0.0,0.00819672131147541,0.600273865,17.15,8490.18324,8,0.702348295,0.55277,2012-May-01,WEC
Great Thank you And reconciling the dilution with cash flow what are the typical terms from the shipment to when the impact is actually paid to the OEM,3,28,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03571428571428571,0.0,0.600273865,17.15,8490.18324,8,0.702348295,0.55277,2012-May-01,WEC
Great and I guess I 'm not sure if you mentioned this earlier but any update in terms of the projected expense savings when you complete the Metavante conversion for both Northern New England and Southern New England,1,38,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02631578947368421,0.0,1.773470563,17.15,5631.89202,12,0.8362683940000001,3.00607,2012-May-01,JEC
So the {CARDINAL} spreads that are open are not included in the {MONEY},1,13,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.773470563,17.15,5631.89202,12,0.8362683940000001,3.00607,2012-May-01,JEC
And {CARDINAL} more quick questions First off is there a chance of steel resetting in {DATE} if it continues to rise Or is that That 's not an issue,4,29,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.034482758620689655,1.494604758,17.15,5881.4256799999985,11,0.480957373,0.8432700000000001,2012-May-01,AMG
Okay I appreciate all that But let me just ask one little follow up to that Is there anything about I know the new underwriting that you 're doing that could lead to the ultimate hit rate no matter how long it takes to be lower than it has been historically,3,51,0,0.0,0.0196078431372549,0.0196078431372549,0.0,0.0,1.494604758,17.15,5881.4256799999985,11,0.480957373,0.8432700000000001,2012-May-01,AMG
This is the most important issue I think I 'm not the only one who thinks it Just a quick follow up is that level of if you think about that level of repatriation in {DATE} is that a normal level When we think about cash flow how do we think about a normal free cash flow level relative to what we see which is the US statutory earnings number,4,70,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.086956816,16.6,6804.70973,6,0.33430318600000003,0.97906,2012-May-02,MCHP
As a follow up on the Mining you guys sound very optimistic on what you 're seeing there in general so I 'm guessing you have n't seen any pullback on the part of customers during a period of dislocation coming out of the summertime And your expectations for that Business are at least as optimistic as when you bought the Aker business {DATE} If you could verify that maybe add some color there,3,74,0,0.0,0.02702702702702703,0.02702702702702703,0.02702702702702703,0.0,1.086956816,16.6,6804.70973,6,0.33430318600000003,0.97906,2012-May-02,MCHP
Okay And then maybe for Sandeep on the leasing front What 's your target on occupancy costs for new leases signed over {DATE},3,23,0,0.0,0.043478260869565216,0.043478260869565216,0.0,0.0,0.920458429,16.6,9018.35116,8,0.411696072,5.04009,2012-May-02,OKE
Hi good {TIME} Just {CARDINAL} related questions First from the bigger picture you gave {PERCENT} I believe {DATE} same store NOI guidance for the portfolio Admittedly that 's {PERCENT} of the portfolio right now But from a high level is that what you think given your current portfolio mix the company can generate on a same store basis Is that is there any reason to think that over the cycle that {PERCENT} or a different number perhaps would be achieveable And then specifically on the Life Sciences portfolio you had {PERCENT} Just wanted to get a quick question about how much of that is driven by what really are n't Life Science tenants but the LinkedIn Google deals and maybe give a number absent those,8,125,0,0.0,0.016,0.024,0.008,0.016,1.387630238,16.6,16801.792,11,0.605948213,0.46359,2012-May-02,GGP
Okay Then in the slides and everything else where you 're showing all these margin adjustments for NVS that 's just for demonstration purposes not obviously try to get to a {MONEY} EPS number,2,34,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.387630238,16.6,16801.792,11,0.605948213,0.46359,2012-May-02,GGP
But you 're not actively going to push it materially lower,1,11,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.387630238,16.6,16801.792,11,0.605948213,0.46359,2012-May-02,GGP
Okay Good that 's helpful And then a follow up for maybe Mac on the accelerated expansion you talked about the branches that are coming online in and Is the incremental expense done at the end of,5,37,0,0.0,0.02702702702702703,0.02702702702702703,0.02702702702702703,0.0,1.22031456,16.6,6782.318759999999,11,1.433021905,4.34085,2012-May-02,UNM
Okay Perhaps I am miss remembering I had thought the commentary was {MONEY} to {DATE} and maybe updated guidance {DATE} It is fair to say then that net net no headwinds from the US sales initiatives,4,36,0,0.0,0.05555555555555555,0.05555555555555555,0.0,0.027777777777777776,1.410895978,16.6,15385.65353,9,0.256038137,3.56351,2012-May-02,WFM
Okay and then just a general question On the lanes that you served that are competitive with trucking can you just give us a general sense in terms of what the pricing differential is between truck and rail intermodal shipments whether it be domestic or international {DATE},2,47,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02127659574468085,0.921518393,16.6,4428.40783,11,0.353011601,0.72228,2012-May-02,AJG
Okay fair enough And then a separate question Sallie Mae took a {MONEY} charge {DATE} on expected compliance for mediation efforts relating to ongoing regulatory pleas which we assume is tied to that CFPB 's ongoing review of student loan servicing Is that something we should potentially expect to see from you in {DATE},4,54,0,0.0,0.0,0.018518518518518517,0.0,0.037037037037037035,0.921518393,16.6,4428.40783,11,0.353011601,0.72228,2012-May-02,AJG
A question about the tax rate in {DATE} Because the tax rate was {PERCENT} or so in {DATE} in other words should we be using a {PERCENT} tax rate for {DATE} or should {DATE} tax rate be slightly higher or lower How do we balance that out,3,47,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02127659574468085,1.751361234,16.6,28574.18055,4,1.045453457,2.1614,2012-May-02,DVN
Do you think down {CARDINAL} units is as bad as it gets or does it get worse than that and then stay worse than that for a while similar to what we 've seen in the U.S.,1,37,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08108108108108109,2.46760281,16.6,13017.9672,4,1.159860151,2.54853,2012-May-02,CHK
Okay and so we should look at CapEx as being essentially flat for {DATE},1,14,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.630230466,16.88,5994.9477,8,0.932431971,4.02744,2012-May-03,SCG
But you think there 's still an argument for continuing to invest in the business even just a dollar of investment here even if the ROE is n't rising,1,29,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.034482758620689655,0.906718681,16.88,15368.95308,8,0.8669772309999999,0.11676,2012-May-03,SRE
What percentage approximately would go into those markets through service centers We 've seen inventories under pretty good control obviously but is there any percentage guidance that you could give me on that,2,33,0,0.0,0.030303030303030304,0.06060606060606061,0.030303030303030304,0.0,0.906718681,16.88,15368.95308,8,0.8669772309999999,0.11676,2012-May-03,SRE
And then what might be accounting for that in Europe as well,1,12,0,0.0,0.08333333333333333,0.08333333333333333,0.0,0.0,2.16296391,16.88,7015.42696,11,2.933495255,0.98029,2012-May-03,LNC
Right Claiborne can I ask several quick questions {CARDINAL} on Kikeh when is your best guess now that you 're going to reach the next pay out ratio,3,28,0,0.03571428571428571,0.0,0.0,0.03571428571428571,0.03571428571428571,1.768683126,16.88,10734.38763,4,0.926875049,0.29649000000000003,2012-May-03,MUR
Okay And on the numbers that you reported for {DATE} I mean your costs of goods sold was down pretty significantly sequentially And just to clarify the charge the {MONEY} charge what line item was that expense recognized in,3,39,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.384326655,16.88,4690.20328,12,0.798883294,3.3107300000000004,2012-May-03,PWR
So you are saying that the {DATE} FAS CAS line would be similar to the incoming {CARDINAL},1,17,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.384326655,16.88,4690.20328,12,0.798883294,3.3107300000000004,2012-May-03,PWR
{CARDINAL} longer term question The {MONEY} for Chinese DCT was that included in your investor presentation slides and your projection of the DCT market Is that incremental to that,3,29,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.034482758620689655,1.384326655,16.88,4690.20328,12,0.798883294,3.3107300000000004,2012-May-03,PWR
And a leverage point there John,1,6,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7217407020000001,16.88,5226.60114,8,1.091909993,0.27263000000000004,2012-May-03,PNW

Just thinking about timing for {DATE} with the GRC waiting on the PD and then formalization can you remind me what the time distance or what would be the normal process once you have the PD to {CARDINAL} too a final order in the GRC Just if we can try to figure out how much time we have left in {DATE} before all the catch up money goes into {DATE} or whenever that shows up,2,75,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.81462027,17.56,15791.92,8,0.848520637,0.6652,2012-May-04,PPL

Okay all right That 's helpful {CARDINAL} question also When you look at the guidance you have revenue I guess before reimbursables versus topline revenue It 's increasing something like {PERCENT} In other words the revenue before reimbursables as a percentage of total revenue from customers is obviously up Is that also just sort of dealer related stuff or just can you help us understand the moving is there anything we need to understand there around the moving parts,7,79,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.012658227848101266,1.798305569,22.27,8243.933,6,0.231530667,0.44386,2012-May-17,ADSK

{CARDINAL} questions for you and one is actually probably the first one is a good follow up to that At {CARDINAL} point you guys were talking about a development pattern for a {CARDINAL} unit that I believe has {CARDINAL} horizontals in the Wolfcamp and then an incremental I think {CARDINAL} or vertical wells Should we just assume that that model is not applicable going forward Or is that still something that you guys are contemplating,4,75,0,0.0,0.0,0.04,0.013333333333333334,0.013333333333333334,1.513374849,19.45,36143.62589,3,0.209514548,5.02597,2012-Jun-28,NKE

Hi good {TIME} On the direct real estate business how much money have you raised but maybe not invested yet and how quickly are you putting dollars to work here,2,30,0,0.0,0.03333333333333333,0.03333333333333333,0.03333333333333333,0.0,1.459174754,17.11,125976.69,6,0.400230928,1.14388,2012-Jul-17,INTC
Okay Then second if we just think about during the decline we saw towards the end or {DATE} which was pretty severe across the board was there anything that you could tell whether you were picking up or gaining or losing market share in your segments,2,46,0,0.0,0.021739130434782608,0.021739130434782608,0.021739130434782608,0.06521739130434782,2.075848361,17.11,11048.93048,11,0.641136004,1.73205,2012-Jul-17,HST
Good {TIME} Hi Just following on some of John 's points and what you wrote in the press release Of the factors you listed how would you rank those factors in terms of their impact between the tough comps and {DATE} and I guess market conditions right now,4,48,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.020833333333333332,0.0,1.392778954,16.48,11321.13519,11,0.744610752,0.44517,2012-Jul-18,NTRS
Okay Can we expect you to employ the same strategy in {DATE},2,12,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.883243593,16.48,92764.38654,6,0.329712284,0.5967899999999999,2012-Jul-18,QCOM
Hello This is Siti Panigrahi for Phil On the new customer wins we were hoping you could comment on the pricing trends that you 're seeing for new customers versus existing customers,3,32,0,0.0,0.03125,0.03125,0.0,0.0,1.54674596,16.48,42496.53174,3,0.27269956100000003,1.7809700000000002,2012-Jul-18,HON
And the other question I had on fiscal {CARDINAL} guidance I know it 's tough but can you provide any sort of guidance for interest expense and shares outstanding,1,29,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.034482758620689655,2.263403981,16.48,5104.17201,5,0.364752423,0.41269,2012-Jul-18,ALB
Is still not good enough Does that have any implications if we were to increase the number of UAVs overseas,2,20,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05,0.0,1.375850695,16.48,67535.57484,11,0.342294851,1.54091,2012-Jul-18,AXP

So you do n't foresee shutdowns and delays happening in {DATE} in {DATE},1,13,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15384615384615385,1.689626266,16.48,25905.79152,11,1.387483583,2.02984,2012-Jul-18,BK
Okay And as we look at trying to get a better understanding of reserve bookings on the Spraberry The {CARDINAL} unbooked locations that you have drilled to date how many offsets are you planning on booking,3,36,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.027777777777777776,0.0,1.666925995,16.48,9470.39748,3,0.50121879,1.17905,2012-Jul-18,DOV
Can you detail out how many European stores you 'll build in {DATE} or is that too early,1,18,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.352240334,16.48,23682.41082,12,0.726672141,1.33212,2012-Jul-18,CSX
Okay that 's helpful And if we kind of roll all those up are we talking about a {MONEY} potential contribution to surplus Is it anything in that ballpark,3,29,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.352240334,16.48,23682.41082,12,0.726672141,1.33212,2012-Jul-18,CSX
Okay finally on the accounting change with the noncontrolling interest are there any margin impacts or anything that we should look at for a modeling going forward,1,27,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.869037811,16.16,7231.5927,12,1.427918571,1.34464,2012-Jul-19,LUV
So if materials to continue to reverse to the downside though we could I guess presumably expect to see some pretty big benefits {DATE} and into {DATE},1,27,0,0.0,0.037037037037037035,0.07407407407407407,0.0,0.0,1.89463335,16.16,30189.64245,9,0.068816634,1.29737,2012-Jul-19,YUM

Got it Then just a quick follow up This is all just operating earnings drags as opposed to anything in terms of DAC or reserve builds that could happen Is that correct And can you provide any sensitivities around or thoughts around the potential for something other than just kind of normal earnings drag,5,54,0,0.0,0.018518518518518517,0.018518518518518517,0.0,0.037037037037037035,0.980230644,16.16,31248.94376,10,0.237239201,0.93286,2012-Jul-19,BAX
Good {TIME} Congrats on {DATE} here and thanks for taking our questions As you look to expand PNH into other geographies such as Brazil Turkey Russia I thought it was interesting some of the comments made by GSK on their call on {DATE} Wanted to get your take on whether or not you think their pharma experience is applicable to your efforts And specifically {QUANTITY} things that they mentioned {CARDINAL} was that they 're seeing they see very strong initial growth for {CARDINAL} {DATE} time frame followed by very intense scrutiny over government spending levels And then secondly they 're seeing the majority of their sales in the EM emerging markets as cash payers minority government reimbursement To what extent do you think that their pharma experience is applicable to yours with Soliris and to what extent do you think that your ultra orphan model makes you immune to that scrutiny as we 've seen in emerging markets,8,158,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.012658227848101266,0.0189873417721519,0.980230644,16.16,31248.94376,10,0.237239201,0.93286,2012-Jul-19,BAX

Got it That Delta should we expect that Is there anything anniversary in there that we should expect the gap to narrow to some extent over time in the near term,3,31,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.6541410719999998,16.16,21938.14184,10,0.145392251,1.7470900000000005,2012-Jul-19,ISRG

Is that did prices move enough that you are It does n't look like your hedge prices really moved Is that because prices did not move enough within the collars or they did move and it just gets averaged rounded out,3,41,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.019814614,16.16,31339.7773,12,0.541819633,1.18795,2012-Jul-19,FCX

Fair enough And then the excess capital of {MONEY} {MONEY} does that include the ability to add leverage or is that just the calculation you went through of where you would be after a bank sale without taking on additional debt,2,41,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.401653071,16.16,36099.41094,6,0.522545747,0.4086,2012-Jul-19,DHR
Great Is the reason the differential between the volume growth and the revenue growth was that still that higher value mortgage is down and that should reverse in {DATE},2,29,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.034482758620689655,0.0,1.597333897,15.45,9690.30812,6,1.120219579,0.19504,2012-Jul-20,XRX
Yes thanks Good {TIME} everyone and Jim I 'd like to echo the comments Good to hear you again Question for Mike Rahm taking that demand Outlook that you gave for {DATE} both in potash and phosphate the expectations internally on industry capacity utilization And maybe Mike if you could give a little more color on the breakdown of the demand growth in potash and the key regions that are driving it Particularly expected demand growth in North America and Brazil,6,81,0,0.0,0.024691358024691357,0.024691358024691357,0.024691358024691357,0.024691358024691357,1.928920896,16.27,31003.9055,6,0.348469274,1.7344,2012-Jul-23,TXN
In {DATE} you completed {PERCENT} less wells but {PERCENT} more were horizontal completions and production outperformed guidance Going forward what percentage of completions do you target to be horizontals,2,29,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.034482758620689655,0.0,1.887121126,16.27,3448.53014,11,1.537085312,0.87636,2012-Jul-23,ZION
I see If you were to try to being bring capital back let 's say in {DATE} would your tax loss position allow for some degree of a shield of the cash that would be coming back from Latin America,2,40,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.025,1.887121126,16.27,3448.53014,11,1.537085312,0.87636,2012-Jul-23,ZION
Okay Great And then as my follow up question the {MONEY} of productivity gains that 's quite a bit higher than what you 've generated in {DATE} which has averaged I think {MONEY} Is this inclusive of the incremental or unusual weather expense that you saw {DATE} or is that on top of the {MONEY},4,55,0,0.0,0.0,0.01818181818181818,0.03636363636363636,0.01818181818181818,1.958773236,18.62,3983.36708,12,0.201515537,1.67639,2012-Jul-24,RHI
Okay good And then why is n't the gross margin target a little more aggressive in the back {DATE} Because it seems like if you look at the currency spot rates like the incremental impact kind of lessens but the commodity flow through should be a little bit better on the pullback Am I wrong in that calculus,4,58,0,0.0,0.0,0.017241379310344827,0.034482758620689655,0.017241379310344827,1.958773236,18.62,3983.36708,12,0.201515537,1.67639,2012-Jul-24,RHI
Just a quick question on {CARDINAL} cycles If you look at the time lag between volume growth and margin stabilization you mentioned this you have more volatility and more speed now What does the past usually look like How long does it take before we get to stabilization in the margin,4,51,0,0.0,0.0,0.0196078431372549,0.0392156862745098,0.058823529411764705,1.795689703,18.62,13351.695,2,0.458969567,0.29354,2012-Jul-24,PCAR
Hi this is Desi filling in for Bob Thank you for taking my question Just speaking on that topic maybe a little further along there Do you think the easing of credit standards could be maybe what gets us from {CARDINAL} starts {DATE} to {CARDINAL} or {CARDINAL} starts or is it a smaller incremental upside from where we 're at,4,60,0,0.0,0.05,0.05,0.0,0.03333333333333333,1.795689703,18.62,13351.695,2,0.458969567,0.29354,2012-Jul-24,PCAR
Hi good {TIME} Nice execution on {DATE} I think it 's fair to assume at this point that the team is probably in negotiations with all of your initial customers for their next round of expansion on the solar side So I guess the question is what kind of ramp rates are we talking about here Are we going to see second phase expansion maybe doubling the initial capacity and then a big step up to let 's say {QUANTITY} of capacity or even gigawatts of capacity,5,87,0,0.0,0.011494252873563218,0.034482758620689655,0.011494252873563218,0.011494252873563218,1.402015868,18.62,23516.83097,12,0.7227091609999999,1.44474,2012-Jul-24,NSC
Okay That 's helpful And just to be clear my understanding is more of your SQ customers are surcharge eligible versus your LQ customers Is that in fact the case,4,30,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.191918235,18.62,4481.2197,12,0.360837685,4.5164,2012-Jul-24,TSS

Good {TIME} everyone I was hoping you could provide a little bit more color on the capital budgeting process for {DATE} Most specifically have you changed the way you 're forecasting production In the past it 's my understanding you 've forecasted production based on your published type curves Is that still the case Or are you now forecasting based on higher EURs on like you mentioned with the Bone Spring on bigger completions,6,74,0,0.0,0.013513513513513514,0.013513513513513514,0.013513513513513514,0.0,1.849195671,18.62,2926.765360000001,3,0.544158789,0.72196,2012-Jul-24,AVY
Okay That 's helpful And then {CARDINAL} last question in terms of that as it applies to credit Are we seeing now given that you 're going to add to provision in the reserves going forward has loan loss reserve bottomed here,4,42,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047619047619047616,1.849195671,18.62,2926.765360000001,3,0.544158789,0.72196,2012-Jul-24,AVY
And the UK looks a little better for {DATE} at this point and I 'm going to guess utilities maybe a little bit behind plan not much but a little Are you thinking that the base of the UK should cover any load weakness you might have had in the first part of {DATE},2,54,0,0.0,0.037037037037037035,0.037037037037037035,0.018518518518518517,0.018518518518518517,1.849195671,18.62,2926.765360000001,3,0.544158789,0.72196,2012-Jul-24,AVY
Okay so then what happens if you 're in the midst of a review of the already seen delays when you reach a settlement Could that settlement be merged into the same review Would you have to have a second review,3,41,0,0.0,0.024390243902439025,0.024390243902439025,0.0,0.024390243902439025,1.438474908,18.62,16825.75856,5,0.396584103,0.14269,2012-Jul-24,APD

Thank you Lazard Capital Markets First of all congratulations on {DATE} here guys A couple of quick point of clarification if I may you guys talked about still that double digit growth {DATE} and backlog as up high single digit {DATE} You are talking about a soft So does that mean a seasonal strong and is even going to be stronger than sort of like what we 've seen in the past Can you guys sort of qualify that statement a bit more as to where exactly it is going to come from and how you are thinking about that,7,100,0,0.0,0.01,0.02,0.02,0.0,1.46219013,18.62,25571.96092,3,0.448651869,0.6389199999999999,2012-Jul-24,ITW

Continuing on with the Sunrise margins I 'm curious as to whether or not not when you said the {PERCENT} NOI growth on a normalized basis your margins I calculate at {PERCENT} and when you look at the other operators Brookdale and Ameridith they tend to be in {DATE} Would you expect in {DATE} and {DATE} you could see outsized NOI growth as those margins close,3,66,0,0.0,0.015151515151515152,0.015151515151515152,0.0,0.0,2.726141619,20.47,7792.96005,7,0.437450293,2.67496,2012-Jul-25,EQIX
A couple questions {CARDINAL} I appreciate the color on the weather issues in {DATE} but is there any way you can quantify what the hit was in and what you are assuming in And my {CARDINAL} follow up questions it sounds like there is a lot of bidding activity on the electric utility transmission side Is there anyway you could quantify the bids you have outstanding {DATE} versus {DATE} Like you did on the gas side I think on the gas side you said you had {MONEY} in bids outstanding that should materialize over {DATE} and any color on that as well,7,102,0,0.0,0.00980392156862745,0.0196078431372549,0.0,0.0196078431372549,1.710115739,20.47,18317.33544,3,1.074921051,0.19139,2012-Jul-25,GLW
Would you expect that those are going to have stronger same store NOI growth in the existing {DATE} or is it going to be relatively stable between the {CARDINAL},1,29,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06896551724137931,0.0,1.710115739,20.47,18317.33544,3,1.074921051,0.19139,2012-Jul-25,GLW

Final question just given just the spike in your revenue growth in MIS in {DATE} is it reasonable to think MIS revenues could be down in,1,26,0,0.0,0.038461538461538464,0.038461538461538464,0.0,0.038461538461538464,1.090865083,20.47,8691.52885,10,0.248837005,1.56887,2012-Jul-25,BCR
Can you clarify a couple things you said about the cost trend You said cost trend would be at the lower end of the guidance range of {PERCENT} and you said MLR would be above the midpoint of the guidance range I assume the difference there is the spend on Medicare Star scores Can you talk about how much you 're spending on Medicare Star scores in the MLR component and what exactly the impact there is to you guys,4,80,0,0.0,0.0,0.0125,0.0,0.0,1.009541382,20.47,58661.88732,10,0.269714351,0.1457,2012-Jul-25,BMY
Got it got it And just my follow up along the same path it seems like the foundry players are spending for yield and demand So in a scenario if the macro economy deteriorates in {DATE} in your view do you think the foundry players continue to invest for whatever reasons they want to do it for {DATE} or do you think they will scale back {DATE},3,67,0,0.0,0.0,0.014925373134328358,0.0,0.014925373134328358,1.838105809,20.47,6381.76864,3,0.7284911270000001,0.8835700000000001,2012-Jul-25,LRCX

Okay And I 'm just curious is there anything at Trimark in Canada Looked like there was an unusually large outflow in {DATE} I think it was {CARDINAL} your outflows for {DATE} Was there a particularly large account or {CARDINAL} that left or anything unusual there,5,46,0,0.0,0.0,0.043478260869565216,0.0,0.0,1.077326337,20.47,7811.07102,12,0.229092535,0.7791899999999999,2012-Jul-25,SRCL
Okay So ex some sort of modified program we should expect probably something more in the low to mid single digits on the fixed annuity block,2,26,0,0.0,0.0,0.038461538461538464,0.0,0.0,1.535916223,20.47,18284.34334,6,1.034004151,2.98707,2012-Jul-25,TMO
Okay And then moving on to the future development pipeline I know you had said you had cash on hand to finance the existing pipeline How should we think about financing for future projects,4,34,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.588854289,20.47,40923.9859,8,0.674163987,0.41473,2012-Jul-25,SO
And then just in terms of margin in terms of the production cuts at Chillicothe Is there any expectation for a sequential decline in margin in {CARDINAL} versus {CARDINAL} and then heading out to {CARDINAL} kind of an uptick there Any type of guidance around that,3,46,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.021739130434782608,0.588854289,20.47,40923.9859,8,0.674163987,0.41473,2012-Jul-25,SO
Oh thanks I just had a follow up question Actually {CARDINAL} Judy you mentioned higher sales in unaudited channels Why I guess is the question Is that a change in the strategy in terms of how you 're contracting in those channels or what exactly And then Dick at {CARDINAL} point {DATE} you said Merck may actually get into the medical device business {TIME} you referenced the Fox hollow collaboration I question as whether medical devices is there anything else outside the traditional pharmaceutical space are areas you would potentially consider building a presence in,9,95,0,0.0,0.010526315789473684,0.010526315789473684,0.010526315789473684,0.031578947368421054,0.588854289,20.47,40923.9859,8,0.674163987,0.41473,2012-Jul-25,SO
Okay so to sum up for myself with the pressure you 're seeing there 's nothing with the pressure we 're seeing in the consumer to make you think {DATE} from now gross margin should be lower in this industry than it is {DATE} in fact perhaps higher based on things you can do,1,54,0,0.0,0.018518518518518517,0.018518518518518517,0.0,0.0,1.926472884,20.47,15512.028,9,0.256038137,1.72439,2012-Jul-25,WFM

With {PERCENT} increases in sales how much of that was pricing versus volume Can you just break that down for us,2,21,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047619047619047616,1.993846014,20.47,9298.53375,6,0.219973825,0.7677,2012-Jul-25,ROK
Okay then {CARDINAL} other financial question and then I 'll jump back in queue You talked about the CoreValve litigation You obviously just went through the trial and in the UK and you have a trial ahead of you in Germany how much are you spending in litigation in terms of how much of a hit that was that in {DATE},4,61,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04918032786885246,1.290619386,20.47,31305.59409,5,0.188356686,0.25,2012-Jul-25,PX

Okay fair enough And then in the Eagle Ford obviously very good well results to date Any early indications of what EUR 's look like out of the liquids rich versus the dry gas window,3,35,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02857142857142857,0.0,2.100256093,19.34,10040.66472,12,0.753752547,4.98674,2012-Jul-26,RSG
Hi guys thanks for fitting me in Question on your guidance I 'm still having a little bit of trouble reconciling it So if I take the midpoint at {DATE} you 've got revenues up {PERCENT} you 've got operating profit up about the same amount {PERCENT} with OpEx up {PERCENT} So I can see where the margin compression is coming from there But you 've got EPS up {PERCENT} so it sounds like there 's quite a bit of cost or some other kind of compression below the line that 's affecting the difference between the operating profit increase and the EPS increase Can you give me some feeling for what that actually is,7,115,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.017391304347826087,3.859973638,19.34,3844.16298,12,0.802986344,2.38551,2012-Jul-26,PHM
So you had a lot of pricing go through in {DATE} And as you look back were there any areas that maybe surprised you either better or worse in terms of the consumer reaction to that And so did that cause you to make any adjustments as you went along from your pricing strategy,3,54,0,0.0,0.018518518518518517,0.018518518518518517,0.018518518518518517,0.018518518518518517,1.094691203,19.34,19233.74973,11,0.598898061,1.7289900000000002,2012-Jul-26,VTR
Okay Just {CARDINAL} other follow up on the aftermarket You 've got this mix here with OEM aftermarket as a little bit of a reason for the margin pressure What kind of improvement do you need to see in aftermarket to maybe help offset that OE strength Is it just getting back to a more normalized sort of,5,58,0,0.0,0.017241379310344827,0.017241379310344827,0.034482758620689655,0.0,1.473027865,19.34,6480.9673600000015,6,0.041692468,0.10702,2012-Jul-26,VRSN
Great Thank you And then just wondering if you can comment what you are seeing out of the major OEM dealerships with respect to rental Clearly the rental channel is growing very fast Your average OEM dealership amongst the majors is not seeing that level of growth right now So are you seeing the OEMs respond aggressively by adding more to the rental fleet or any color there would be helpful,6,71,0,0.014084507042253521,0.0,0.0,0.014084507042253521,0.0,1.473027865,19.34,6480.9673600000015,6,0.041692468,0.10702,2012-Jul-26,VRSN

Okay And then one follow up We 've seen a number of longevity swap transactions in the UK but very little activity in the US What do you think is driving this and is there any reason that longevity swaps would n't become more prevalent in the US over time,4,50,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.940140795,19.34,61581.14,10,0.275898382,0.23448,2012-Jul-26,MMM
Got it If I could potentially sneak {CARDINAL} last {CARDINAL} in just in terms of the mix of subscriptions that we are seeing is it remaining relatively constant with the strong heavily weighting towards the maintenance subscriptions Or are you starting to see a richer mix of desktop subscriptions in there,3,51,0,0.0,0.0196078431372549,0.0196078431372549,0.0196078431372549,0.0,0.658320079,19.34,28703.17032,8,0.814338421,3.0499,2012-Jul-26,NEE
Good {TIME} guys Tom you were able to outline the expected EPS impact for {DATE} of {MONEY} Do you guys have a number for {DATE} Is there a reason we ca n't get a little bit more detail on that,4,40,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05,0.0,0.658320079,19.34,28703.17032,8,0.814338421,3.0499,2012-Jul-26,NEE
I know Bob you made some comments at the beginning of the call but I jumped on a little bit late Can you you did a super deal with this Tyler Can you talk to kind of your deal pipeline as it relates to other things that could fit in that type of mold I do n't mean just in refrigeration but across the portfolio,4,65,0,0.0,0.015384615384615385,0.015384615384615385,0.0,0.015384615384615385,2.9089911980000003,19.34,3309.08844,3,0.875069943,0.22222,2012-Jul-26,FBHS
Okay got it very helpful And then if you looking at {DATE} how much would the capacity case impact your outlook especially if you do n't get an order until potentially late or {DATE},2,34,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.029411764705882353,1.491069439,19.34,5838.5755,12,0.416592565,1.84026,2012-Jul-26,EFX
Okay So if you get {MONEY} in revenue in {DATE} Did that convert to say {MONEY} in {DATE} and then we will increase to like {MONEY} in {DATE},3,28,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.319013733,19.34,2924.58863,6,0.41087158,0.31901,2012-Jul-26,FLIR
Your volume declines impacted your results negatively by {MONEY} in {DATE} And I 'm just curious what kind of expectations of recovery of that lost profit do you expect in {DATE} and {DATE} How soon do you expect to catch up all of this loss,3,45,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08888888888888889,1.469811798,19.34,2856.3325,11,1.391934192,2.18317,2012-Jul-26,AIZ
That 's helpful Can you give us an update in terms of how much of the data being collected by the My Rate bundles is actually being incorporated into pricing now,2,31,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.99917826,19.34,12941.0568,6,0.222482125,4.75737,2012-Jul-26,CERN
Okay And if that is the share repurchase budget then that contemplates that the {MONEY} cushion would basically remain in place Can we think about that at some point potentially being drawn down,3,33,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.246537828,19.34,6350.44305,3,0.226956548,1.18404,2012-Jul-26,BLL
Let me ask the question another way I 'm good at that What would cause you not to need to issue that much equity if there is anything,3,28,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03571428571428571,0.03571428571428571,1.246537828,19.34,6350.44305,3,0.226956548,1.18404,2012-Jul-26,BLL
Okay That 's fair And the commentary around building solutions is really encouraging and obviously we 've seen a pickup in general construction activity but I am wondering the performance contracting energy saving part of that portfolio are you seeing similar trends there And there is a bit of a debate that low energy prices means that some of this will get pushed out Do you agree with that thought process,5,71,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.014084507042253521,0.0,1.6891070069999998,17.53,12313.02532,11,0.434945199,0.70467,2012-Jul-27,WY
Okay And just finally Ron the follow up from Rich 's question earlier If you were to adjust Drivetrain margins {DATE} for all the efficiencies all the China launch and the delays what would the margin have been {DATE},3,39,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02564102564102564,0.05128205128205128,1.6891070069999998,17.53,12313.02532,11,0.434945199,0.70467,2012-Jul-27,WY
Mac I was hoping you could maybe you could just flesh out what 's going on in overall commercial yields and just pace of degradation I got what you said about pricing pressure is going to continue But can be a little tough from the outside to see given the impact of HCF the pace of degradation whether that softened at all in {DATE} What are your thoughts there,4,69,0,0.0,0.043478260869565216,0.043478260869565216,0.0,0.028985507246376812,2.095386232,17.53,3520.16014,11,1.5153165240000002,0.99994,2012-Jul-27,LM
I wanted to go back to the earlier comments on what the large fleets have been saying because I think other than Swift actually all that have made {DATE} comments have actually said they 're going to continue to grow their fleets {DATE} in addition to normal And some have even said accelerated replacement to get the average age down With that dynamic and then looking at your forecast for {DATE} to get the retail sales decline in the industry is the bridge between those {CARDINAL} things maybe just a deceleration in fleet growth So {DATE} was a very healthy year of expansion {DATE} is going to be good but just not at {DATE} 's level,5,116,0,0.0,0.008620689655172414,0.008620689655172414,0.008620689655172414,0.017241379310344827,1.581929209,17.53,5156.01,3,0.397633614,1.87028,2012-Jul-27,NWL
Okay great Thanks And then my last one Debbie probably for you just given as we close in on {DATE} and at least as of right now tax law is going to change and going to increase I think for Ventas specifically that may mean there could be additional acquisition opportunities I wonder if you could share some color on that And also more broadly what your perspective is given your visibility and the people you 're talking to whether or not people are starting to change their behavior in anticipation of those changes,5,94,0,0.0,0.031914893617021274,0.05319148936170213,0.02127659574468085,0.0,1.662255224,17.53,3429.64,10,0.66753834,0.32681,2012-Jul-27,UHS
Got it Thanks and as a follow up on the SMSC transaction A very strong margin expansion early on can you talk about just the revenue synergies and opportunities that you see over {DATE} on that side,3,37,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05405405405405406,0.0,1.298946999,17.53,213581.414,4,0.649565885,4.11956,2012-Jul-27,CVX
Couple things First just a little bit more clarity on this {PERCENT} price in {DATE} versus the guidance for {PERCENT} I just do n't understand how if you 're getting pricing on that amount of your business right now why that would change {DATE} so quickly Could you give just a little bit more flavor on that,4,57,0,0.0,0.017543859649122806,0.017543859649122806,0.0,0.0,1.298946999,17.53,213581.414,4,0.649565885,4.11956,2012-Jul-27,CVX
Agreed And I guess to that point Jay since you bring that up would n't it be a good trade if you will this does n't say the reinsurers are dumb so much but would n't it be a good trade to buy reinsurance at a low to mid teens cost of capital to be able to buy back your stock while below book which is probably a {PERCENT} {PERCENT} return on capital,3,73,0,0.0,0.0,0.0136986301369863,0.0410958904109589,0.0,2.685902136,17.53,5985.3748,12,0.917246649,0.68699,2012-Jul-27,DHI
Hi guys I 'm assuming your guidance contemplates a range of scenarios at the ODAC panel and back in {DATE} the uncertainties that were left were indications specific restrictions and what to do in the range of {CARDINAL} So I guess the question is on the low end of your guidance what scenario are you assuming coming out of ODAC,2,60,0,0.0,0.0,0.05,0.0,0.016666666666666666,0.712061168,17.53,10227.13344,8,1.10574585,2.52275,2012-Jul-27,DTE
And then just the second and final question I have is Congress passed I think it was {DATE} a Medicare bill which was previously thought might be very challenging to pass Do you have any kind of renewed optimism or a change in outlook about a SCHIP build getting passed anytime in {DATE},3,53,0,0.0,0.018867924528301886,0.018867924528301886,0.0,0.03773584905660377,0.712061168,17.53,10227.13344,8,1.10574585,2.52275,2012-Jul-27,DTE
Okay but there likely would be once you identify it and decide to take those actions,1,16,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.521228979,16.7,9605.72229,6,0.437903787,0.33333,2012-Jul-30,ROP
Sure Okay Then when you go look at the document management segment margins look a little bit further just {PERCENT} would you expect that to generally be the floor at this point just given where scrap paper prices are currently assuming there is really no change in generally what you are seeing on the revenue growth side do you think that 's the floor or is there still some potential that that margin comes down just given where scrap paper prices are,3,82,0,0.0,0.0,0.012195121951219513,0.0,0.0,1.521228979,16.7,9605.72229,6,0.437903787,0.33333,2012-Jul-30,ROP
CPG {CARDINAL} thing I did n't expect to see was CPG volumes up Has that business turned the corner,2,19,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.126657669,16.7,4923.327,10,0.976345651,1.47044,2012-Jul-30,HOLX
Hello Sorry I was on mute I had aI had a quick question on the expense savings that are earmarked in the settlement and I know for the filing did you for the commission {DATE} some of those expenses were capitalized and some were expensed Is that the same is that the same for the {CARDINAL} over {DATE} or are those more kind of expense savings,4,66,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.015151515151515152,1.296490951,18.03,19912.4759,5,0.4130572320000001,0.13463,2012-Jul-31,ECL

Hi guys This is Uche Take thanks for taking my question Just wanted to drill down on your guidance for {DATE} First question is how much of {DATE} revenue number is covered by the current backlog And also I see that your inventory has gone up significantly so just wondering if inventory and building in anticipation of higher revenue or how do you explain that,7,65,0,0.0,0.0,0.015384615384615385,0.0,0.03076923076923077,0.784146896,18.03,15221.88992,8,1.152086083,0.46995,2012-Jul-31,EIX
Okay great And the corporate services side I mean as stock prices have risen certainly more people have incentive to sell restricted stock if it 's vested So does that help to support potentially more activity from that segment,3,39,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02564102564102564,0.0,2.059618895,18.03,3558.906,12,0.473112374,1.17108,2012-Jul-31,MLM
Is that something that 's a sustainable thing,1,8,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.851357961,18.03,6329.6280000000015,3,0.432737071,0.7651100000000001,2012-Jul-31,FLS
When you talked about the Cal Pine asset acquisition you said it would be accretive in {DATE} Could you give us some sense of the magnitude of that accretion,2,29,0,0.0,0.034482758620689655,0.034482758620689655,0.0,0.0,1.891498706,18.03,5057.8976,12,0.8362683940000001,0.51203,2012-Jul-31,JEC
Okay But just to be clear other than the projection for software sales there 's nothing else either higher cost or some other offsets that we should think about,2,29,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.3598109269999998,18.93,9251.49252,8,0.411696072,1.51707,2012-Aug-01,OKE
Okay And I guess as I think {CARDINAL} and I know there has certainly been some effort at getting some guidance there but as you think about maybe buying versus building would you expect to develop more {DATE} versus buy,4,40,0,0.0,0.025,0.025,0.0,0.0,1.3598109269999998,18.93,9251.49252,8,0.411696072,1.51707,2012-Aug-01,OKE
Hello I guess first on the CapEx backlog you were far enough into {DATE} do you have a sense for how much of a tailwind you will have {DATE} just from on site projects coming on stream,3,37,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.072033638,18.93,10903.61712,4,0.6938906440000001,1.24987,2012-Aug-01,PXD
Just checking the weather for AGA It looks like {DATE} for {DATE} Is it still too early to have any cooling driven weather at all,3,25,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.072033638,18.93,10903.61712,4,0.6938906440000001,1.24987,2012-Aug-01,PXD
And would that be the same for any type of potential acquisitions like you again are n't looking to significantly change your leverage,1,23,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.355324634,18.93,37551.91392,12,0.923229194,0.97466,2012-Aug-01,TWX
Okay so in {DATE} it 's going to be profitable of course But margins given lower revenue growth might be under little bit of pressure Is that the right way to think about it or you 're not going to guide towards a region,3,44,0,0.0,0.022727272727272728,0.022727272727272728,0.022727272727272728,0.0,1.575318256,18.93,9253.64524,10,0.361205857,0.38156,2012-Aug-01,DVA
First just in terms of guidance can you help at least directionally how you think about the {CARDINAL} segments that you guys have,1,23,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.575318256,18.93,9253.64524,10,0.361205857,0.38156,2012-Aug-01,DVA
Yes that is fair The {PERCENT} pretax margin that you guys talked about so I am curious do you think that is an achievable number for {DATE} And maybe even if you just look at existing business business that if you take your {DATE} book and roll it forward would you assume that you can at least get to {PERCENT} on your existing book Or do you think you can even get there on {DATE},4,75,0,0.0,0.013333333333333334,0.02666666666666667,0.0,0.0,1.400981017,18.93,7930.6759,11,0.590724483,2.82845,2012-Aug-01,KIM
Okay because some of your competitors or peers are talking about anywhere from {CARDINAL} different formations prospective in each drilling location Is that,2,23,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.2794872309999998,18.93,67365.1545,7,1.205071962,1.03642,2012-Aug-01,CMCSA
Thanks First a question for Cathie Now that you 're back to target inventory levels in printer supplies how should we think about growth going forward and also your ability to keep the margins at {PERCENT} in light of supplies mix perhaps improving,3,43,0,0.0,0.023255813953488372,0.023255813953488372,0.023255813953488372,0.023255813953488372,0.984139561,18.93,4270.51472,11,0.353011601,1.10325,2012-Aug-01,AJG
Got it Then the loan growth outlook I think it was {PERCENT} over {DATE} Is that predominantly driven by commercial real estate Or is that a little more balance between CRE and some of the other categories,4,37,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.8677649810000005,18.93,1351.5138,6,1.254991976,1.86735,2012-Aug-01,FSLR

Hi Good {TIME} I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your acquisition plans for {DATE} You were saying that you were going to buy as many assets as you were selling I was wondering if you could give a rough range in dollar terms And also are there particular markets where you want to gain exposure,6,60,0,0.0,0.03333333333333333,0.05,0.03333333333333333,0.0,2.260253475,18.96,22219.86,11,1.580033941,3.28046,2012-Aug-02,PRU

Okay And then remind us what the drag on the merchant wind farm is in {DATE} and are there any initiatives to maybe mitigate that in {CARDINAL} and beyond,2,29,0,0.0,0.034482758620689655,0.034482758620689655,0.0,0.034482758620689655,2.050884309,18.96,10562.7392,4,0.926875049,1.66065,2012-Aug-02,MUR
Thank you so much guys I appreciate it I know that on the pick up in desktops you had said it was n't all corporate refresh but obviously some of it was Is there any chance that enterprise just had a fixed budget and so more of it went to the corporate refresh in {DATE} And so they had a little bit less to spend on the data center and that could account for some of the delta there,5,79,0,0.0,0.012658227848101266,0.012658227848101266,0.0,0.0,1.57073372,18.96,5316.7914,11,1.433021905,1.61523,2012-Aug-02,UNM

And not to beat a dead horse but it 's the issue of the moment Tangible common equity versus {DATE} which wins and I think you 've been consistent Bob all along about Tier and that 's what the regulators look at But I guess {CARDINAL} question for the end of life security losses went from {MONEY} to {MONEY} Where is it as of right now What 's it done {DATE},7,71,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.028169014084507043,1.653591663,18.96,6407.0875799999985,7,0.266832245,2.13206,2012-Aug-02,SNI

Good {TIME} Just a couple quick questions Just looking back it looks like natural gas usage has been increasing while coal usage has been decreasing Just looking forward into the future I 'm just trying to get an idea of how big of a risk you think that how big of a risk factor you think that is when it comes to the clean coal tax credits going forward,4,69,0,0.0,0.0,0.028985507246376812,0.014492753623188406,0.014492753623188406,0.833464504,17.57,5166.39072,8,0.94040326,4.04535,2012-Aug-03,LNT

{CARDINAL} quick questions I want to make sure I 'm understanding the guidance correctly First of all in terms of the charge offs you said this quarter {MONEY} was absorbed by the reserve So if we take {CARDINAL} and add {CARDINAL} and then subtract {CARDINAL} for the OCC impact that takes me {MONEY} Is that am I thinking about the underlying charge off number in the right way,6,68,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.014705882352941176,1.46146284,17.57,21239.22605,7,0.396284231,1.18854,2012-Aug-03,VIAB

Good {TIME} Thank you Question about your project business Number one can you talk about your confidence in doing {CARDINAL} to perhaps {QUANTITY} {DATE} And could you also talk about the economics of that I think Rob alluded to wanting to having {PERCENT} above the cost of capital Do you expect to do that on the project business and given the EPC component how do you get there Do you have lower expenses so you can potentially get to a similar operating margin once you get the scale,8,88,0,0.0,0.022727272727272728,0.022727272727272728,0.011363636363636364,0.011363636363636364,0.827170883,17.47,11104.24,1,0.115775697,2.73546,2012-Sep-04,CPB

And then I 'm also just wondering relative to the restructuring payback I think the goal is {MONEY} gross savings I think that 's an incremental {MONEY} or so off the {CARDINAL} base Is that still the right framework and maybe a little color on how that builds over the course of {DATE},2,53,0,0.0,0.018867924528301886,0.018867924528301886,0.0,0.018867924528301886,2.415902148,13.98,11126.01864,6,0.146800152,1.16961,2012-Sep-24,RHT

On the program you told us in the past that you have been booking around a {PERCENT} margin I 'm just wondering what 's in your plan for {DATE} and what you did in {DATE} Is that changing at all,3,40,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.158233175,12.94,4502.29563,12,0.377244898,0.14215,2013-Feb-12,MLM

And when we think about the earnings impact of a {MONEY} of conserved premium given the fact that it 's {PERCENT} American Income how should we think about what the dollar amount to bottom line is then,1,37,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.539580934,12.98,7239.232559999998,12,0.654390304,2.70136,2013-Feb-14,VMC

Thanks Tom Going back to Prime as you consider the price increase do you think the brand is such that you would be willing to price tailor it or tier it based on the value that is offered and the sort of services you provide to certain customers And then second on the categories I believe you called out {DATE} that Clothing in particular was {CARDINAL} and third party Clothing had picked up a lot Did you see that {DATE} just given the importance of that core category in {DATE},4,90,0,0.0,0.0,0.011111111111111112,0.0,0.0,0.7978254379999999,12.98,17724.58182,8,0.851986777,0.5068699999999999,2013-Feb-14,PPL

And to follow up on that if I throw out a number that some of the survey data that we 've collected would show that {PERCENT} of patients showing up for procedures are getting turned away because of insufficient vascular access how would you respond to a number like that,1,50,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02,0.7978254379999999,12.98,17724.58182,8,0.851986777,0.5068699999999999,2013-Feb-14,PPL

Okay So it 's the same type of rate that you 're guiding for {DATE} and beyond So why such a big delta,3,23,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.578941727,12.98,15660.944480000002,4,0.595486974,0.45563,2013-Feb-14,PXD
Good {TIME} First off just to clarify a little bit on Minnesota They 're not resale So when we factor in the rate case that was just completed does that make a dent as far as your lag in {DATE} is concerned Do we should be think of an appreciable improvement in earned ROE {DATE} or not versus {DATE},5,59,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03389830508474576,0.03389830508474576,1.154699188,12.98,8797.67129,2,0.383214976,0.89897,2013-Feb-14,BWA
Thank you My question essentially follows to Rick It has to do with the Windows OEM revenue bridge Just curious on some of these items how they fit {DATE} For instance and I believe Bill and Peter you take account for that inventory changes in the Windows attach and inventory line and {DATE} it added {PERCENT} of {DATE} {DATE} it was a {PERCENT} hit and Bill you noted the inventory drawdown had an effect there Can you give us a sense of where you think channel inventories are {DATE} relative to what you might call normal levels And then also just quickly on the last line in the bridge the OEM revenue adjustment when does this stop going to stop being negative It 's been slightly negative for quite some time now and should n't it have stopped like {DATE} after the Vista launch because was n't it related to XP and having internet explorer as part of that as a meaningful part of that versus true Vista,9,168,0,0.0,0.005952380952380952,0.011904761904761904,0.0,0.03571428571428571,1.154699188,12.98,8797.67129,2,0.383214976,0.89897,2013-Feb-14,BWA
That 's because of the loss of the relationships that you talked about,1,13,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07692307692307693,1.833252187,12.98,17961.18009,10,0.109076194,2.83777,2013-Feb-14,ALXN

Then on the services side you said you saw some delays in some of the turnaround work How long can that work be deferred when do you think you should see people resume back to a normalized run rate,2,39,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02564102564102564,0.722400299,12.66,20032.7179,11,0.491215217,1.55774,2013-Feb-15,VTR
Okay And then the second question I had relates to assets under management which were down I think {MONEY} or {PERCENT} {DATE} Was that a function of performance within the products or it was a function of fund flows or fund outflows I should say,4,45,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.022222222222222223,0.722400299,12.66,20032.7179,11,0.491215217,1.55774,2013-Feb-15,VTR
And then just kind of {CARDINAL} last one Maybe you are still working this out but can you talk through maybe some of the big categories in terms of toilet tissue diapers and other types of tissue Like what magnitude of pricing you are talking about in the US as you go through the second round here in the fall,3,60,0,0.0,0.03333333333333333,0.03333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.722400299,12.66,20032.7179,11,0.491215217,1.55774,2013-Feb-15,VTR
Okay and then just with respect to the Biosciences business could we just get an update on what you 're seeing with research spending and if anything has changed there,1,30,0,0.0,0.03333333333333333,0.03333333333333333,0.0,0.0,1.138707292,12.66,8063.71635,11,0.338388896,0.61152,2013-Feb-15,DLR
Okay So ex that what would auto yields have looked like,2,11,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.252545879,12.46,3773.5716,3,0.562507423,2.17343,2013-Feb-19,SEE

You do after they finish the treatment,1,7,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.801556996,12.46,11082.55864,9,0.304515054,11.54734,2013-Feb-19,GPC
But I mean right now you 're on the margin maybe {PERCENT} of the time or {PERCENT} of the time on coal to balances gas Correct,3,26,0,0.0,0.038461538461538464,0.038461538461538464,0.0,0.0,0.801556996,12.46,11082.55864,9,0.304515054,11.54734,2013-Feb-19,GPC
So if you really did have outstanding data that would be an especially nice thing to have them open to,1,20,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.556559185,12.46,5620.83795,4,0.919367271,1.80785,2013-Feb-19,XEC
Great relative to transactions I know you mentioned that you are being cautious but you are obviously looking at some acquisition opportunities recent transaction data for Senior Housing suggests that cap rates are somewhere in the {CARDINAL} range Does that seem accurate relative to what 's coming across your desk,3,50,0,0.0,0.02,0.06,0.04,0.0,1.408259401,12.31,24530.85,4,1.229207923,0.4396600000000001,2013-Feb-20,DVN
Bernard this puts you at what ROE level by getting the {PERCENT} range across these products,1,16,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.954330875,12.31,8065.1874,8,1.2720269990000002,0.42202,2013-Feb-20,AEE
Okay And could you elaborate a little bit more about the change in parent and other,2,16,0,0.0,0.0625,0.0625,0.0,0.0,0.954330875,12.31,8065.1874,8,1.2720269990000002,0.42202,2013-Feb-20,AEE
Hi good {TIME} Zane will should we be thinking about as we are modeling out {DATE} will there be a timing mismatch between when some of the costs changed Whether you can start to get synergies or you have got to start to pay labor more versus when you kind of get the productivity from that Is there going to be sort of lumpiness we should be thinking it through,5,70,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.014285714285714285,0.014285714285714285,0.954330875,12.31,8065.1874,8,1.2720269990000002,0.42202,2013-Feb-20,AEE
So based on what you see how earlier we were you in the process here and is this an area you could be more active yet sometime {DATE},1,28,0,0.0,0.03571428571428571,0.07142857142857142,0.0,0.0,1.391891515,14.68,3935.33985,9,0.388841956,0.04485,2013-Feb-21,PDCO

Okay And then just sticking with dividends and I realize it 's a little early to think about it but we do have a potential change in tax law here coming at {DATE} I mean how does that inform your thoughts about capital allocation whether it 's dividends buybacks things like that,2,52,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.665747034,14.68,9901.72464,4,0.552254893,0.71729,2013-Feb-21,CXO
And last one and I 'll hop off This is a little bit out in left field but I 'm curious with all the issues we 've seen in market with counterfeit drugs as of late is there anything you can do in your returns and recall business to help preserve the supply chain integrity or is that too far field what you currently offer,1,65,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.015384615384615385,0.046153846153846156,1.665747034,14.68,9901.72464,4,0.552254893,0.71729,2013-Feb-21,CXO
Rick in terms of the outlook for {DATE} and orders and your projected uptick in {DATE} could you just give a little color in terms of do you see the decline in {DATE} being offset by the same uptick in {DATE} Or is the magnitude just going to depend on when the customers come back,2,55,0,0.0,0.03636363636363636,0.03636363636363636,0.0,0.01818181818181818,1.665747034,14.68,9901.72464,4,0.552254893,0.71729,2013-Feb-21,CXO
Good {TIME} And Peter I 'll echo my sentiments as everyone else did as well So in recent periods we 've seen your MBD growth significantly outpace PC unit growth although we now have a dynamic where your Office subscription is really resonating with customers So the question is just looking at this on a directional basis is MBD revenue outperformance relative to PC units something that you think is sustainable going forward,4,73,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0136986301369863,0.0136986301369863,1.665747034,14.68,9901.72464,4,0.552254893,0.71729,2013-Feb-21,CXO

Good {TIME} This is actually Anthony in for Amanda Just a couple quick questions First you have definitely had a number of new product launches {DATE} Would you be able to add a little bit of insight or maybe some more specifics regarding the potential growth impacts for {DATE} and potentially {DATE} as well regarding these new product launches,5,59,0,0.01694915254237288,0.01694915254237288,0.01694915254237288,0.03389830508474576,0.01694915254237288,0.699987785,15.22,5988.523,8,1.094639405,3.23097,2013-Feb-22,PNW
Fran you mentioned that you were accelerating a bit the copper shutdown In the past you have mentioned that a gating factor was regulatory approval to shutting down the copper plant for those that wanted circuit switched lines I 'm wondering if there has been any sort of change in the local regulatory environment that allows you to accelerate that And then secondly I think in the past you have mentioned the shutdowns would be in {MONEY} Is that materially going up And is that a thing where you would sacrifice a bit of margin and maybe spend a bit more CapEx to accelerate this process,6,106,0,0.0,0.009433962264150943,0.009433962264150943,0.0,0.03773584905660377,0.699987785,15.22,5988.523,8,1.094639405,3.23097,2013-Feb-22,PNW
Thank you Bill you noted you 're reducing the return on capital hurdle rate from {PERCENT} I believe you said down to {PERCENT} Should we interpret that as a signal that you 're looking to maybe accelerate the unit growth rate in the future or rather does it reflect diminishing returns in the industry,4,54,0,0.0,0.018518518518518517,0.037037037037037035,0.0,0.018518518518518517,0.699987785,15.22,5988.523,8,1.094639405,3.23097,2013-Feb-22,PNW
Okay And then just the last question maybe I do n't know how much you can say on the OIG subpoena but clearly a lot of the regulatory and questions that have been related to the psych business over really {DATE} have been more clinical type of questions as opposed to billing questions Is there any way to look at the wording of the thing and make any assessment as to whether it 's which of those {QUANTITY} directions it seems to be going,3,84,0,0.011904761904761904,0.011904761904761904,0.023809523809523808,0.0,0.07142857142857142,0.839817809,15.22,4142.12204,11,0.370201211,3.73091,2013-Feb-22,EXR
Then similarly as you think about the automotive business and the near term impact of having major regions shut down such as your home area there do you think that the organic growth in the automotive let 's say company owned comps do you think that ticks down in {DATE} as well because of some of this weather noise,1,59,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01694915254237288,0.839817809,15.22,4142.12204,11,0.370201211,3.73091,2013-Feb-22,EXR
Hi this is actually Greg calling on for Manav Just wanted to ask about the guidance It looks like excluding ZEE Medical and the buybacks the guidance is essentially unchanged even with the pretty solid numbers Just wondering if there 's been a change to your view versus when you first gave guidance or if there 's if it 's kind of a conservatism so early in {DATE},4,68,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.839817809,15.22,4142.12204,11,0.370201211,3.73091,2013-Feb-22,EXR
Okay And then just as you think about where you want to finance these loans do you still consider yourself to be a prime lender as some of your loss rates push up against {PERCENT} and if they move {PERCENT} what does that imply for spreads going forward,2,48,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041666666666666664,0.954717933,14.17,16954.47664,8,1.127989589,0.08272,2013-Feb-25,FE
Right Okay And on the Vestas turbine redeployment as an unreg asset what type of returns on your investment do you expect from that,3,24,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.954717933,14.17,16954.47664,8,1.127989589,0.08272,2013-Feb-25,FE
I know you said it was n't entirely clear what was causing the slowdown in commercial volumes comparatively anyway Is there any indication that you are seeing individuals that were previously covered by exchange plans coming off of those plans Or do you think it 's more just seasonal weakness in {DATE} that comes back in {DATE} What are your thoughts there,4,62,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03225806451612903,0.954717933,14.17,16954.47664,8,1.127989589,0.08272,2013-Feb-25,FE
Any way to size those account losses just so we know what the impact is going to be over an {DATE} basis,1,22,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045454545454545456,1.008036775,18.99,9453.1206,8,0.424885652,2.0,2013-Feb-26,OKE
Is there things that you are working on {DATE} that are more pressing or this is more of {DATE},1,19,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05263157894736842,0.80442003,18.99,18315.45196,8,0.7228247059999999,1.22899,2013-Feb-26,SRE
And then in terms of I guess {CARDINAL} other questions on is there anything you can tell us there based off of the early clinical work I know it 's very distinct from {CARDINAL} chemically but is there anything we can learn from the initial data that you have there as to your expectations of what it should look like when you put it into patients,2,66,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.015151515151515152,0.95977565,18.99,14971.01545,8,1.063816846,5.93007,2013-Feb-26,EIX
And Lee you said the tax rate was down in {DATE} Can I assume that it goes back to the range,2,21,0,0.0,0.0,0.047619047619047616,0.0,0.0,0.95977565,18.99,14971.01545,8,1.063816846,5.93007,2013-Feb-26,EIX
So as a total company it was probably about a percentage point So that was {PERCENT} underlying,2,17,0,0.0,0.0,0.058823529411764705,0.0,0.0,3.2836064960000004,18.99,2853.52018,6,1.3470157980000002,2.72059,2013-Feb-26,FSLR
I have a couple on advertising trends So can you just dig into a bit about the calendar up front versus the broadcast upfront Can you give us a sense of how the pricing turned out calendar wise in the upfront versus the broadcast Was it similar types of inflation {DATE},4,51,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.021186397,16.87,41683.3557,9,0.458384314,0.33125,2013-Feb-27,TGT
Okay and then you are also expecting top line to be up for the rest of the business too,1,19,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.017288659,16.87,31846.47851,9,0.122773687,1.07506,2013-Feb-27,TJX
Okay that 's helpful And then just {CARDINAL} last one for me for Aldo Can you say what the delinquency rates have been running at with the portfolio,3,28,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03571428571428571,1.066685633,16.87,9062.8538,12,0.045543332,10.18143,2013-Feb-27,VRSK
Does your commentary on slowing loan growth play a part in just the lack of other options you have for that capital With all things equal with the same price would you buy more stock because of the lack of loan growth opportunities,2,43,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.023255813953488372,0.06976744186046512,1.911847612,14.73,10720.7661,9,0.6237605070000001,2.0131900000000003,2013-Feb-28,KSS
Alright fair enough And again following up on the little granular detail here the energy efficiency component of the Ohio program recently approved as of {DATE} what is the total megawatts that you 're seen come out of that program that you would expect to bid,2,46,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.021739130434782608,0.0,1.581709318,14.73,6841.64703,9,0.328840036,1.35243,2013-Feb-28,LKQ
Okay And then just from a P&L standpoint all of that you have going on either on new plans or those that are in the works what kind of expense benefit would you get {DATE} if you do n't see a reacceleration or an acceleration in anything that is maybe not planned Is it possible that you see expense leverage improved {DATE} since some of these costs roll off,3,69,0,0.0,0.028985507246376812,0.028985507246376812,0.028985507246376812,0.0,1.581709318,14.73,6841.64703,9,0.328840036,1.35243,2013-Feb-28,LKQ
Good {TIME} Can you talk a little bit about material cost and any trends that we should be expecting as we go through the year especially given the decline that we 've seen in some of the commodity prices,2,39,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02564102564102564,0.02564102564102564,1.551132926,15.51,5233.719120000002,10,0.614015041,1.6188,2013-Mar-01,UHS
Okay And then a quick follow up your gross margin appears to be trending {CARDINAL} bps higher than {DATE} is that a trend you expect to sustain through the rest of {DATE},2,32,0,0.0,0.03125,0.03125,0.0,0.0,1.551132926,15.51,5233.719120000002,10,0.614015041,1.6188,2013-Mar-01,UHS

Understood And then just a follow up on just thinking about the tax positions you highlighted in {DATE} There are number of moving parts in terms of uncertain tax positions and lower tax benefits On a going forward basis in {DATE} and beyond without being specific numerically how should we think about those kinds of moving parts When do they start to settle down or when will they become less material as we think {DATE},5,75,0,0.0,0.013333333333333334,0.013333333333333334,0.0,0.0,1.044242017,13.53,15221.22224,9,0.3516695,0.0415,2013-Mar-07,KR
Okay Yes No Both sides were actually really strong Thanks for that And just a follow up Steve you mentioned that you are working through the restructuring initiatives Just in that context how should we think about the operating margin expansion {DATE} relative to your goal of {CARDINAL} basis points of same store margin expansion per year,7,57,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.017543859649122806,0.017543859649122806,1.602852485,12.59,6031.92096,9,0.216751947,0.56403,2013-Mar-11,URBN
Thanks {CARDINAL} questions I guess {CARDINAL} is it looks like you 're inflight investment CapEx expectation went done {MONEY} I 'm just wondering if that is relating to is that a project or property you may be close to selling or why that change inflight And also if just have any comments about the pace of your pipeline in China Given the supply growth there has your expectation for the pace of pipeline in China slowed at all,7,78,0,0.0,0.01282051282051282,0.01282051282051282,0.0,0.02564102564102564,2.164441088,12.67,9557.646,6,1.218528661,1.10152,2013-Mar-21,MU
Can you talk a little bit about what type of activity you 're seeing in your regions Some CEOs I would say the majority of the CEOs over {DATE} are talking about they saw material slowdown in activity or loan demand towards {DATE} Are you experiencing the same thing I know you are a little bit different geography wise but just wondering how do you see it shaping up,4,69,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.014492753623188406,2.164441088,12.67,9557.646,6,1.218528661,1.10152,2013-Mar-21,MU
And then just on the dry grocery side great performance there but we 've been hearing a lot down at CAGNY and other venues that there 's been some inventory deloading and destocking Does n't seem like it based on the sell through that you had Did you note any inventory issues either at the consumer level or the grocery level,3,61,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01639344262295082,0.0,2.164441088,12.67,9557.646,6,1.218528661,1.10152,2013-Mar-21,MU
Right right Okay And then just lastly on the prefs you indicated there 's another plug of prefs to do here at some point when market conditions avail themselves of you I 'm just wondering what 's your sense on that kind of timing or when you 'd want to get that done Part of me was thinking maybe you would do it by {DATE} that just passed for CCAR reasons but I 'd like to get a sense as to how you 're thinking about it Given the fact that term structure has come down so much is there an opportunity here,6,103,0,0.0,0.009708737864077669,0.009708737864077669,0.009708737864077669,0.0,1.589283793,12.77,9514.8045,6,0.155584504,15.61699,2013-Mar-27,RHT
So how much of your anticipated {DATE} group is on the books right now,1,14,0,0.0,0.0,0.07142857142857142,0.0,0.0,0.822138845,13.15,12642.76816,12,0.15138322699999998,1.3294700000000002,2013-Mar-28,PAYX
First question just on capital With I guess the positive changes that we have seen to Basel III capital ratios when you look ahead to {DATE} and your Basel III number is higher than where you previously thought it was going to be do you think that gives you any more flexibility under the {DATE} CCAR process to ask for more capital return than you may have otherwise under different Basel III rules,2,73,0,0.0,0.0136986301369863,0.0136986301369863,0.0136986301369863,0.0136986301369863,0.822138845,13.15,12642.76816,12,0.15138322699999998,1.3294700000000002,2013-Mar-28,PAYX
So we 'll see So I want to follow up on the M&A and part of Roger 's job now I think is the opportunity to look at sourcing larger deals And we see the Intermec integration was pretty rapid fire with the benefits So I 'm wondering are you just starting to develop the pipeline for larger deals or is that something that 's already kind of established,4,69,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.014492753623188406,0.0,1.408199653,13.15,17423.91108,5,0.62953328,0.3073,2013-Mar-28,MOS
Okay so fairly static conditions If the Fed cuts further and the ECB sort of stays in your target range is there upside to your NIM guidance based on that,2,30,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6438700860000001,12.78,14708.44224,1,0.497198355,0.49741,2013-Apr-03,CAG
Thanks good {TIME} everyone Just a couple of quick ones Regarding prasugrel could you discuss any efforts you have made so far to construct the sales effort and the status thereof Secondly regarding gross margin does Zyprexa in Canada and Germany generics have an effect on gross margin And maybe you did state it Derica but could you discuss the potential for gross margin effects for the remainder of {DATE} And then third was there stocking during {DATE} Humalog KwikPen and/or Cialis QD,6,83,0,0.0,0.03614457831325301,0.03614457831325301,0.012048192771084338,0.0,1.194314534,12.78,55635.84,5,0.260927555,2.02471,2013-Apr-03,MON

Great thanks And then just a quick follow up on Phoenix Obviously a lot of work on the metallurgy and there 's some chemistry in there How about the real basics How are we doing on the crushing plant and throughput there,5,42,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.023809523809523808,0.0,1.138029395,12.24,188732.3978,11,1.165940813,2.93352,2013-Apr-12,JPM
Hi thanks for taking the question Clearly your revenue guidance for {DATE} contemplates booking a milestone revenue for denosumab up front Can you help us understand what the quantity of that that is included in your guidance,3,37,0,0.02702702702702703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02702702702702703,0.922699817,12.24,197822.1135,11,0.803716113,1.10774,2013-Apr-12,WFC
Okay And metallurgical recoveries does it ramp up as well Should we expect them to be quite weak initially,3,19,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05263157894736842,0.5636029379999999,17.27,228545.8116,10,0.348930917,0.91625,2013-Apr-16,JNJ
And on that front I 'm assuming we should continue to expect some of this going forward to some extent not just from you but more broadly,1,27,0,0.0,0.0,0.037037037037037035,0.0,0.0,0.5636029379999999,17.27,228545.8116,10,0.348930917,0.91625,2013-Apr-16,JNJ
Got you And then a follow up on the value added services You mentioned previously that you expect that to become {PERCENT} of your revenues in {DATE} potentially What was it in {DATE} and where is it trending in {DATE},4,40,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.4775584869999998,17.27,43146.29946,11,0.867313192,0.66985,2013-Apr-16,BLK
Could you talk just quickly about fee waivers whether you think you 're at a normalized rate at {MONEY} in {DATE} or is there some more pressure in {DATE} coming,1,30,0,0.0,0.03333333333333333,0.03333333333333333,0.0,0.0,1.4775584869999998,17.27,43146.29946,11,0.867313192,0.66985,2013-Apr-16,BLK
How much further can you expand that pipe now that its completed,1,12,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.464556673,17.27,105788.24,6,0.535728579,0.22246,2013-Apr-16,INTC
Given the strength of east coast margins in {DATE} I 'm just curious if you can give us guidance as to whether Delaware City would have been profitable in the current environment,1,32,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0625,0.0,1.025798092,13.96,57172.6428,10,0.265619372,1.29506,2013-Apr-17,ABT
Right That was going to be my next question on the pricing So I guess as we move forward how should we think about that Are you do you plan to continue these hedges as you have in the past Or should we be modeling this a little closer to the actual foreign exchange influence,5,55,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01818181818181818,1.10920995,13.96,8554.72968,6,0.115766481,4.61021,2013-Apr-17,LLTC
My first question is on the {MONEY} of CAT losses you mentioned in {DATE} Are you able to break that down into commercial lines and personal lines basis,2,28,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03571428571428571,0.10714285714285714,1.137317038,13.96,34237.30365,11,1.15023282,3.31114,2013-Apr-17,PNC
Okay And rewards picked up a little bit as a percentage of interchange revenue Discount revenue Does this represent a kind of a new run rate or are you still seeing a little bit of upward inflation in rewards expense,4,40,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05,0.0,1.137317038,13.96,34237.30365,11,1.15023282,3.31114,2013-Apr-17,PNC
Thanks for the additional color around adjusted EBITDA margins by business or by the base business That is where my question is You talked {PERCENT} adjusted EBITDA margins for the base business with McKechnie and {PERCENT} for {DATE} Can you give us an idea Nick of the spread between the base in McKechnie how McKechnie is tracking relative to {PERCENT} number,4,61,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01639344262295082,1.137317038,13.96,34237.30365,11,1.15023282,3.31114,2013-Apr-17,PNC
Okay and just finally how much of it is locked in for {DATE} versus might be subject to volatility,1,19,0,0.0,0.05263157894736842,0.10526315789473684,0.0,0.05263157894736842,1.58034354,13.96,7992.592,3,0.444784172,1.33134,2013-Apr-17,TXT
Okay And just {CARDINAL} last clarification if I may {TIME} at the Salt Lake conference there was some mention of Adobe.com 's revenues at {MONEY} a year Is the bulk of the revenue transition effect therefore affecting the Adobe.com revenues so that while the adoption is good in terms of organic or unit terms the revenue effect is bringing the revenues lower from the previously stated number for Adobe.com,4,69,0,0.0,0.014492753623188406,0.028985507246376812,0.014492753623188406,0.0,2.357556873,13.96,4880.64301,12,0.6794826959999999,0.94937,2013-Apr-17,URI
So just thinking then about the guide reduction the guide reduction is no longer about your inability to deliver I presume It 's solely on OE volumes or do you think your share was somewhat impaired for awhile because of the initial disruptions with the business,2,46,0,0.0,0.021739130434782608,0.043478260869565216,0.0,0.06521739130434782,1.269418179,13.96,6055.83276,11,1.003406117,1.24799,2013-Apr-17,HBAN
Hi guys Quick question here just any update on the expected timing on the international asset sale,2,17,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058823529411764705,1.269418179,13.96,6055.83276,11,1.003406117,1.24799,2013-Apr-17,HBAN
And rough prices to build in the different regions is it still kind of {MONEY} in India {MONEY} in Latin America just broad build cost,1,25,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.209617209,13.96,12615.31738,3,0.468742804,0.95058,2013-Apr-17,DOV
We will hear it in New York right And I guess additionally on that asset sale do you think about those proceeds as potential reload for the buyback Or as you pull more into free cash flow neutrality,4,38,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.209617209,13.96,12615.31738,3,0.468742804,0.95058,2013-Apr-17,DOV
Could you give us an update on your exchange strategy How many exchanges you may be on and then maybe some discussion about how many other providers you might be competing with How you 're pricing strategy and how you 're approaching this distribution,3,44,0,0.0,0.09090909090909091,0.09090909090909091,0.0,0.0,1.217436009,13.96,9231.96195,10,0.471499328,3.61723,2013-Apr-17,DGX
On the competitive segment the interest expense {MONEY} before capitalization in {DATE} Is that a reasonable run rate going forward or is there something else going in there or have we kind of found a new level with all the repositioning of the balance sheet,2,45,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.217436009,13.96,9231.96195,10,0.471499328,3.61723,2013-Apr-17,DGX
Are there any differences in enrollment criteria that we should keep in mind that could result in a slightly different patient population Or are the patients almost exactly the same,2,30,0,0.0,0.06666666666666667,0.06666666666666667,0.0,0.0,1.217436009,13.96,9231.96195,10,0.471499328,3.61723,2013-Apr-17,DGX
And maybe a similar question I think it 's what you just showed us to put a finer point on it But as you effect the portfolio shift that you and I believe will drive a rerating in your EBITDA your CapEx also rises Do you see your balance sheet liquidity essential MLP liquidity speaking of drop downs as a method for maintaining or increasing distributions despite a rising CapEx number,4,71,0,0.0,0.014084507042253521,0.028169014084507043,0.014084507042253521,0.014084507042253521,1.379930734,13.96,24660.02388,12,0.8485078229999999,4.29191,2013-Apr-17,CSX
Is the UK the only place on the other side of the Atlantic that you 're looking or is it a broader scope than that,1,25,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.379930734,13.96,24660.02388,12,0.8485078229999999,4.29191,2013-Apr-17,CSX
A lot of them do processing as well so do you think that takes away from your third party gathering opportunities You know if they can go to someone else to do gathering and processing whereas with you they can only do gathering Can you kind of talk about that,3,50,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02,0.0,1.379930734,13.96,24660.02388,12,0.8485078229999999,4.29191,2013-Apr-17,CSX
Okay And if I could just sneak {CARDINAL} more in for Scott on the tax expense savings So you mentioned that it will be an ongoing expense savings here Guidance implies {MONEY} of incremental tax expense in {DATE} Is that the right run rate to think about going forward So {MONEY} per year or will it be more chunkier or volatile in nature on a {DATE} basis,6,67,0,0.0,0.014925373134328358,0.029850746268656716,0.0,0.014925373134328358,1.711572453,13.96,132872.97699999998,11,1.7436119019999998,1.03736,2013-Apr-17,BAC
Kent starting off with the subpoenas that were announced after the close can you give us some more information It really sounds like this might be about something else Do you have any color for us,3,36,0,0.0,0.027777777777777776,0.027777777777777776,0.0,0.027777777777777776,1.711572453,13.96,132872.97699999998,11,1.7436119019999998,1.03736,2013-Apr-17,BAC
Thank you good {TIME} Scott first question you guys have told this to us before that the dividend that you are going to get from Enable tax rate on that distribution is going to go up pretty materially over {DATE} So on an after tax basis should we assume that that distribution to CenterPoint should be declining over that {DATE} period as that tax rate jumps up Is that a fair way to think about it,4,76,0,0.0,0.0,0.013157894736842105,0.02631578947368421,0.02631578947368421,1.711572453,13.96,132872.97699999998,11,1.7436119019999998,1.03736,2013-Apr-17,BAC
And then I guess if you 're thinking about acquisitions going forward Bob you mentioned you 're still going ahead with {MONEY} cap raise I guess as you integrate PNC which is somewhat of a complex integration do you still feel you have the capacity to do another large deal in the near to intermediate term if something came up on the asset servicing side,2,65,0,0.0,0.015384615384615385,0.015384615384615385,0.0,0.0,1.578539633,16.51,5351.48064,5,0.343503544,1.83887,2013-Apr-18,ALB
I wanted to follow up on the gross margin topic You had spoken on {DATE} conference call about web exclusives and the dilutive impact they could have on gross margin {DATE} but you did n't mention it too much in the prepared comments So could you give an update on that maybe by brand and your expectations for {DATE},3,59,0,0.0,0.05084745762711865,0.05084745762711865,0.01694915254237288,0.0,1.883555116,16.51,2784.594960000001,11,1.9152697,0.01003,2013-Apr-18,ETFC
Thanks for the color Then turning to Mike LaBelle can you talk about how you are thinking about investment firepower {DATE} I know you said you have pre funded your {DATE} debt maturities But how should we think about what you have now to spend on incremental investment,4,48,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8728999340000001,16.51,15490.91956,12,0.335673119,0.60917,2013-Apr-18,OMC
Yes and then the order of magnitude of the charge is that in line with what you were thinking back then the {MONEY},1,23,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8405127379999999,16.51,4209.92,11,1.258110283,2.47838,2013-Apr-18,PBCT

Got it And then you also mentioned your expectations for the level of turns is about similar to {DATE} If you see robust demand for {DATE} do you believe you are in a full position to be able to supply all that demand,3,43,0,0.0,0.0,0.023255813953488372,0.023255813953488372,0.0,0.8405127379999999,16.51,4209.92,11,1.258110283,2.47838,2013-Apr-18,PBCT
I did n't know if there was something specifically that was coming in below expectation or below projection there as far at some disappointment or something But that 's not the case,2,32,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03125,1.460597956,16.51,13515.1834,3,0.59864846,0.58778,2013-Apr-18,NUE
Yes I wanted to talk a little bit about to take a line with those questions what you 're hearing from your customers on their inventory levels and whether there 's any true optimism that we could see some emergency shipping heading into {DATE},1,44,0,0.0,0.022727272727272728,0.022727272727272728,0.0,0.022727272727272728,1.460597956,16.51,13515.1834,3,0.59864846,0.58778,2013-Apr-18,NUE
I just wanted clarity I 'm not sure if I understood you right or not Kirk but did you say as far as share repurchases go to expect a similar pace market conditions from remaining through the rest of {DATE} as {DATE} so basically {CARDINAL} shares a {CARDINAL} give or take,2,51,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.212744055,16.51,64265.80506,12,0.558867553,2.44325,2013-Apr-18,UNP
My follow up question thank you for that color by the way It was helpful I noticed that this might be a nuance that does n't really matter But I noticed that you did n't change the expectation for US energy tax credits for {DATE} yet you did take the US industry expectations and theoretically your own also higher How why is that,5,63,0,0.0,0.015873015873015872,0.015873015873015872,0.0,0.015873015873015872,1.247038767,16.51,4821.0593,3,0.419248896,3.5297,2013-Apr-18,SNA

Okay And then your other point was you 're going to be taking that better return on that portfolio and using it to be as competitive as you want to be on the loan portfolio and so expectation is that loan spreads continue to pull down over {DATE} at least Can you just give us a sense as to how willing you are to be competitive on price and loan spreads Should we be expecting that overall NIM compression is what you 're looking for here in the event that you get the quality of loan growth you want,4,99,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.010101010101010102,0.0,1.063465066,16.51,240720.6593,6,0.266235225,1.72105,2013-Apr-18,MSFT
Great great And then one follow up On the kind of cost inflation side obviously the cotton bubble seems to be behind us so to speak How are you guys thinking about inflation long term Yes the material side may be getting easier but we kind of all know about the structural wage story in China and emerging markets where a lot of the manufacturing is done How do you see VF in maybe a structurally inflationary environment kind of especially once we get past the back {DATE} And how do you see that impacting the kind of overall market place if we really are going from {DATE} of deflation to some extent a period of inflation,8,117,0,0.0,0.017094017094017096,0.02564102564102564,0.02564102564102564,0.0,0.858720195,16.51,38162.13924,10,0.190548774,1.22731,2013-Apr-18,BAX
And when you say hopefully it sounds like you had some early success with this initiative in {DATE} So is that both on the traffic and on the mix part of that initiative,2,33,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.030303030303030304,0.0,0.858720195,16.51,38162.13924,10,0.190548774,1.22731,2013-Apr-18,BAX
Okay great And then just a question on this temporary liquidity guarantee program When does it actually kick in And is this subject to meeting the criteria for participation Have you guys looked into it You do qualify right I 'm assuming because you 've put it in the chart,6,50,0,0.0,0.0,0.02,0.02,0.02,1.781777863,16.51,10519.78324,9,0.140002559,3.4978800000000003,2013-Apr-18,CMG
Good Good {TIME} I guess the first question is a specific question on the cost savings side for the {MONEY} is it fair to just take {MONEY} out a {DATE} or is there anymore detail in terms of how to think about that,3,43,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046511627906976744,0.046511627906976744,1.532038522,16.51,30806.77504,11,1.200779731,1.3893,2013-Apr-18,COF
Any sort of indication of their longer term intentions with the stock holding,1,13,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.809882169,16.51,20387.33044,10,0.18161228,5.36469,2013-Apr-18,ISRG
On the comments Brett about the internal growth rate of dental {PERCENT} positive later on you said that chair side consumables were up in double digits and grew I think {CARDINAL} {PERCENT} if you excluded something unusual in there Can you explain that a little bit better,2,47,0,0.0,0.0,0.02127659574468085,0.0425531914893617,0.0,2.005969824,16.51,26586.868,12,0.64805058,0.3662,2013-Apr-18,FCX
Jeff do you think you sourced volume from {CARDINAL} on the soup side at all in our Dinty Moore and maybe SPAM brands,1,23,0,0.0,0.043478260869565216,0.043478260869565216,0.0,0.043478260869565216,1.04632979,17.56,11661.5604,9,0.304515054,2.36296,2013-Apr-19,GPC
Okay The finally on the discussion of getting to a better ROE You mentioned you do n't see this as a one time rate case catch up situation You mentioned some efforts obviously you guys are lowering CapEx there and getting a more timely recovery If you could elaborate on that What it is in the non regulated compliance generation CapEx reduction what you did there and why you are coming in with a lower number now,6,77,0,0.0,0.012987012987012988,0.012987012987012988,0.012987012987012988,0.0,0.89211031,17.56,8668.541,10,0.335524147,0.62589,2013-Apr-19,LH
So it sounds like if I could just characterize it you are saying that the higher levels of promo that you guys cited and then back to pricing I think in North America pricing decelerated sequentially in a couple of the categories You are saying that is a comp issue you do n't feel like the competitive environment is particularly more heated right now than it was over {DATE} Is that right,3,72,0,0.0,0.013888888888888888,0.013888888888888888,0.0,0.0,0.89211031,17.56,8668.541,10,0.335524147,0.62589,2013-Apr-19,LH
Thank you good {TIME} Hey Paul just on the backlog given the large number of projects coming on in {DATE} will the {MONEY} backlog be up or down by {DATE} versus {DATE},2,32,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03125,0.0,1.288197488,17.56,14791.12996,11,1.318499703,0.50918,2013-Apr-19,STI
Hi David There were a couple of proposals from the federal government on housing It is a hot topic They introduced {CARDINAL} for making it easy for refinancing And also the proposal on turning some of the distressed single family homes into rentals So just wondering what your thoughts are on that and if you are seeing any impact I mean how are you positioning yourselves for these changes,6,69,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.014492753623188406,0.014492753623188406,1.288197488,17.56,14791.12996,11,1.318499703,0.50918,2013-Apr-19,STI
Okay And then within the pieces of guidance the {PERCENT} segment operating margin I think to get to {PERCENT} for {DATE} after a {PERCENT} {DATE} number you have got to be {PERCENT} or so for {DATE} And you have got a very easy comp in {DATE} as you know because of all the issues with Japan and price cost in {DATE} So is the right way to think about where your thinking is on calibrating the guidance you are still in {PERCENT} range Maybe you have come off the high end there and you are thinking segment margins {PERCENT} there is sort of an implicit plus on the other side of {PERCENT} Or am I missing something there,7,118,0,0.0,0.00847457627118644,0.00847457627118644,0.00847457627118644,0.0,1.6223534869999998,17.56,94502.065,4,0.393758439,0.94218,2013-Apr-19,SLB
Actually maybe just leveraging off of David 's question there and I just wanted to be clear when you were just sort of answering that as well as the opportunities that you are seeing in Field Services and Midstream are you talking about actual Field Services Midstream M&A or are you talking more about the organic like the Mississippi line proposal or I guess is it a combination,2,68,0,0.0,0.014705882352941176,0.014705882352941176,0.014705882352941176,0.014705882352941176,1.6223534869999998,17.56,94502.065,4,0.393758439,0.94218,2013-Apr-19,SLB
But also just to make sure I understand it I understand the percent of sales leverage but from a dollar standpoint is that also what you 're suggesting for {DATE} you 'll spend the same amount of dollars as {DATE},1,40,0,0.0,0.0,0.025,0.0,0.0,1.241607013,14.97,4368.47266,11,1.249097824,4.26746,2013-Apr-22,ZION
Can you share any comments on the B price points versus A price points within your portfolio,1,17,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.007325073,14.39,25160.86168,1,0.249603359,2.33877,2013-Apr-23,RAI^G17
Okay Then just lastly on the incremental margins Drivetrain you commented was pretty low sub {PERCENT} What is your expectation there for {DATE},4,23,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.074692069,14.39,30850.95195,3,0.001316452,3.37861,2013-Apr-23,LMT
{CARDINAL} on the healthcare reform I 'm assuming that is also pressure for Colonial But could you talk about what you see as a potential impact on sales and demand for voluntary products once healthcare reform is implemented And do you see this as a potential catalyst or vice versa a challenge for sales,4,54,0,0.0,0.018518518518518517,0.037037037037037035,0.0,0.018518518518518517,1.13784062,14.39,7663.697009999999,6,0.194964009,1.22555,2013-Apr-23,WAT
Thanks and just {CARDINAL} quick follow up Sorry if I missed this was there an update on the expected timing of the filing,2,23,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043478260869565216,0.95665863,14.39,85976.96469,3,0.343893126,3.99724,2013-Apr-23,UTX
Okay And my second question I guess Gary for you as well kind of {CARDINAL} part {CARDINAL} is just a logistic point the {PERCENT} tax rate is that fair for modeling purposes to assume that to be consistent in {DATE} as well,3,42,0,0.0,0.0,0.023809523809523808,0.0,0.023809523809523808,0.874184741,14.39,31967.4339,11,0.949755594,2.45073,2013-Apr-23,TRV
So if flu continues to trend down then you 'd then it will end up more aligned with your expectations It would n't be a drag in,2,27,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037037037037037035,0.874184741,14.39,31967.4339,11,0.949755594,2.45073,2013-Apr-23,TRV
Hi Thanks for taking my questions Quick question on your {CARDINAL} antibody the anti RSV Give us a little bit of a sense is this going is this ready to move into kids And is this looking at prevention How is it differentiated from Synagis,6,45,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06666666666666667,0.996870817,14.39,17915.96125,5,0.406788955,0.33225,2013-Apr-23,APD
Got it And my last question on top line is is it still fair to say that you 're not really getting much of a benefit from either employment growth or wage inflation,2,33,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.030303030303030304,0.030303030303030304,0.99750639,13.48,9358.10172,12,0.237075469,0.34156,2013-Apr-24,SRCL
Okay great And a question for Mark Could you just address the {DATE} debt maturities,3,15,0,0.0,0.06666666666666667,0.06666666666666667,0.06666666666666667,0.06666666666666667,0.906088598,13.48,8040.887,11,0.864538437,8.70073,2013-Apr-24,SLG
If I could just ask a quick follow up on margins it sounded like you 're comfortable with {CARDINAL} basis points of expansion for {DATE} First quarter guidance looks like it is up {CARDINAL} basis points from what {DATE} number was Does that imply that we should we expect margins to be roughly flat with going forward or how are you thinking about the rest of {DATE} versus the guide,3,70,0,0.0,0.014285714285714285,0.02857142857142857,0.0,0.0,1.095330267,13.48,112914.0173,6,0.314617605,0.08929,2013-Apr-24,QCOM
Is there a way that you can provide a little bit more granularity of that {PERCENT} What the end market exposure is in terms of whether it is aviation energy etc,2,31,0,0.0,0.0,0.03225806451612903,0.0,0.0,0.930167398,13.48,32417.59594,5,0.210719399,0.203,2013-Apr-24,PX
In terms of what you 've seen in the cores in and KP it sounds like there is enough gas in place It is a pressure issue What are the issues there,3,32,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8955482640000001,13.48,24490.4975,10,0.421427063,1.73174,2013-Apr-24,SYK
Okay And then the last part of it do you see BB&T sort of lagging coming out of this because of how you do things or have you really captured the costs and should start to decline from here,2,39,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05128205128205128,1.301830755,13.48,9636.37095,6,0.33574243,1.22336,2013-Apr-24,XLNX

Great And you mentioned your your segment detail it does n't sound like there 's any real major change there Is there any is there any different expectation by geography owe as you look at {DATE} at this point,4,39,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02564102564102564,0.0,1.355476739,13.48,4131.31224,3,0.453105644,1.12274,2013-Apr-24,AVY
You 've spoken to the pressure on the ASC fees I was wondering if you would just quantify that for us in terms of what that means effectively in terms of a realized PMPM in {DATE} what your expectations are in terms of versus {DATE} And if you just could cite anything specifically in terms of the type of specialty products that are n't being taken up as readily,3,69,0,0.0,0.014492753623188406,0.014492753623188406,0.0,0.0,1.355476739,13.48,4131.31224,3,0.453105644,1.12274,2013-Apr-24,AVY
Could you quantify on the average for example what has been the impact on the dose for patients,1,18,0,0.0,0.05555555555555555,0.05555555555555555,0.0,0.0,1.355476739,13.48,4131.31224,3,0.453105644,1.12274,2013-Apr-24,AVY
Have you been adding merchandise in that area just in urban at the different divisions Is there more {DATE},2,19,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.469355933,13.48,6879.821040000002,3,0.7284911270000001,2.77743,2013-Apr-24,LRCX
Thanks very much Steve I guess following up on the last question {DATE} you had said that do n't pay so much attention to the {PERCENT} revenue growth because bookings grew in {DATE} so that was clearly an indicator that the business was still growing pretty strongly Can you say if that bookings growth slowed Are we talking about an incrementally slower growth environment or roughly on track with where we were in {DATE},4,74,0,0.02702702702702703,0.0,0.013513513513513514,0.0,0.04054054054054054,1.871983658,13.48,12681.6618,6,0.256918069,1.21069,2013-Apr-24,CTXS
And you did quantify {PERCENT} of your sales being CapEx similar to the previous question Can you actually quantify what percent of your sales you might consider to be elective,2,30,0,0.0,0.03333333333333333,0.03333333333333333,0.0,0.03333333333333333,3.104188815,13.48,5669.2254,6,0.161398853,1.11607,2013-Apr-24,FFIV
And then lastly if I might a lot of your on site projects are based on achieving some sort of return on capital target How much wiggle room is there in your own procurement of raw materials ENC labor costs and that sort of thing where you could actually get an improved margin as the global deflation starts to take hold a bit,2,63,0,0.0,0.031746031746031744,0.031746031746031744,0.031746031746031744,0.0,1.351618776,13.61,15836.93106,6,0.212439543,2.43119,2013-Apr-25,CERN

Got it And in terms of the wafer fab equipment you said you expect it to be a multi year cycle Given that we 're kind of in the middle of heading toward {DATE} would you care to take at least a swag at what you think {DATE} wafer fab equipment in CapEx would be,3,55,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.3043502,13.61,10441.41265,12,0.260381198,1.12087,2013-Apr-25,UAL
Thanks for taking the questions First question for Derica on the animal health business from Janssen can you just give us some color on the size of that business especially in light of it being incorporated in your guidance Second question on China in particular and your diabetes franchise there I think the New England Journal of Medicine cited there is {CARDINAL} diabetics there and your marketshare relative to your competition is a little bit lower than your competition What are you going to do to remedy that potentially going forward And then {CARDINAL} question for {DATE} Within the {DATE} time period aside from what are the other {CARDINAL} or {CARDINAL} assets that might be positioned for launch at that time,7,121,0,0.0,0.008264462809917356,0.008264462809917356,0.0,0.03305785123966942,1.403666132,13.61,3765.5070200000014,11,1.95873904,2.29151,2013-Apr-25,AIZ
And just given the {MONEY} {MONEY} of earnings growth in {DATE} versus {DATE} will that be the same amount in {DATE} versus {DATE} given based on what we have in the backlog {DATE} or will it be up or down or lower,1,42,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.9757372,13.61,17412.966809999998,10,0.109076194,1.40467,2013-Apr-25,ALXN
Yes thanks for taking my questions {CARDINAL} questions Mike and George First on the display side when do you think you could probably see north of the {MONEY} run rate level if display has been kind of quiet for {DATE} So when do you think it 's going to pop up given that the touch panel has been {CARDINAL} of the hot areas on the Ultrabook side so any color on that,4,72,0,0.0,0.013888888888888888,0.027777777777777776,0.0,0.027777777777777776,1.165894027,13.61,10017.556,3,0.330040182,3.69979,2013-Apr-25,AME

And then you mentioned the out of stocks As far as how you think about the national rollout how much of that is potentially capacity constrained Is that going to drive some of the pacing like might you have a phased rollout or would you be able to about to go to the other {CARDINAL} states at once Or how are you thinking about that,4,65,0,0.0,0.015384615384615385,0.015384615384615385,0.015384615384615385,0.0,1.752734871,13.61,48941.97513,10,0.20730882,3.3994800000000005,2013-Apr-25,BIIB

And then separately as we think about unemployment hopefully peaking here {DATE} do you guys have any sense of once unemployment peaks what happens to consumer credit Does it start trending down or maybe as people run out of savings and benefits there 's still some elevated losses there How do you think that plays out in terms of even if unemployment just stays high what that impacts your consumer book,3,71,0,0.0,0.014084507042253521,0.014084507042253521,0.0,0.056338028169014086,1.059180165,13.61,7048.168559999999,3,0.174632074,3.2527,2013-Apr-25,BLL

Okay And then just a follow up the I guess you have talked about in your analyst day long term spread outlook going down to {MONEY} Even at that environment is it fair to assume that you still make up a slightly higher margin on your optimization business versus straight fee based business,3,53,0,0.0,0.0,0.018867924528301886,0.0,0.0,2.042055855,13.61,6414.09984,9,0.328840036,1.2174200000000002,2013-Apr-25,LKQ

I guess the point I 'm getting too Keith is if you do n't see a big increase in the losses and impairments in real estate then out of the {MONEY} in total provisions for {DATE} and everything else coming down why are n't we going to see a bigger drop in the overall provision for loss in the Capital Finance in {CARDINAL},1,63,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047619047619047616,1.327039942,13.61,11228.56704,9,0.216594217,0.53965,2013-Apr-25,ORLY

I 'm wondering if you could just provide a little bit more color on Europe Your commentary there on Europe in {DATE} was a little bit mixed I 'm just wondering you brought up I think something like cost control initiatives So can you just talk a little bit more on the dynamics in the European market,4,57,0,0.0,0.017543859649122806,0.017543859649122806,0.0,0.0,1.273570405,13.62,9225.11808,11,0.338388896,0.35743,2013-Apr-26,DLR

Good {TIME} and congratulations I just want to go over the general guidance you 've given for the balance of {DATE} maybe review it You said you are still on track to meet your overall guidance expectation with the regulated utilities being better than forecast International being slightly below and generation being uncertain depending on the outcome of Ohio Is that a fair recap,4,64,0,0.0,0.046875,0.046875,0.03125,0.0,1.444874354,13.62,5651.404079999998,10,0.614015041,0.49883,2013-Apr-26,UHS

Okay that 's great And then you have indicated that in {DATE} and even at the very very end of {DATE} you began to see bit of a snapback in recovery and volumes We talked about s weather impact Normally we think of that being additive to what your normal run rate would be normalized run rate would be So in {CARDINAL} you have talked about a {PERCENT} overall sales growth rate Should we interpret from that that as we get into {CARDINAL} and {CARDINAL} that all things equal you would think kind of a normalized growth rate would be somewhere south of {PERCENT} or would it be different than that for some reason,6,114,0,0.0,0.0,0.008771929824561403,0.008771929824561403,0.0,0.7275626590000001,13.62,22946.7984,11,0.491215217,1.64318,2013-Apr-26,VTR

Hi thanks Diana I think that you or maybe Adam you said that growth in {DATE} on an organic basis is probably about flat I wanted to understand if that is more sort of a timing issue I think you said for {DATE} you expect to grow revenue {PERCENT} on an organic basis but wanted to think about your views of organic growth going forward and if you still think you can grow the market,4,75,0,0.0,0.013333333333333334,0.02666666666666667,0.0,0.0,0.99543501,13.61,12194.24921,6,0.399823008,7.58893,2013-Apr-29,ROP

Got it got it And just {CARDINAL} last question on the guidance in Energy Trading It looks like the top end of the guidance assumes {MONEY} in earnings Could we is it fair to assume that is sort of a {DATE} recognition just given the way the segment recognizes earnings historically,4,51,0,0.0,0.0196078431372549,0.058823529411764705,0.0,0.0196078431372549,0.92121663,13.71,17587.27778,8,1.063816846,1.88189,2013-Apr-30,EIX

Okay So if I could sort of paraphrase what you both said is that the actual {CARDINAL} oil wells may be in a somewhat gassier part of the place so they are a little bit more productive on average than that type curve was built for,3,46,0,0.0,0.06521739130434782,0.06521739130434782,0.0,0.0,0.993169918,13.71,20694.03471,11,0.410398157,0.07732,2013-Apr-30,GGP
Thanks for taking the question Hey Rick on the {CARDINAL} buzz that continues to float around about yield challenges and lack of capacity etc Is there something unusual {CARDINAL} new defect mechanisms or something that makes that very different from previous transitions in logic or is this really just the usual sort of teething with a new technology and on the same sort of learning slope that we 've seen historically,3,71,0,0.0,0.0,0.014084507042253521,0.0,0.056338028169014086,0.993169918,13.71,20694.03471,11,0.410398157,0.07732,2013-Apr-30,GGP

To the extent that some of your borrowing costs have gone up I mean do you look to pass on those higher borrowing costs which means the impact of the Fed move is somewhat muted,1,35,0,0.0,0.02857142857142857,0.02857142857142857,0.0,0.0,1.574484545,13.71,13100.11943,11,0.749227648,3.77508,2013-Apr-30,IVZ
Yes like many other companies you have good results you have n't seen any slowdown and yet the markets continue to tank You are sitting there with very good financial position How do you react with that financial firepower At what point to do you go into the market and buy in your own shares At what point do you say now I am going to make another acquisition,5,69,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.028985507246376812,0.014492753623188406,1.546144016,13.71,6782.2145599999985,12,0.736280204,0.6554,2013-Apr-30,JEC
Okay Last question and also on development the Woburn and Bowery Place projects that appear to be fully leased at this point Where did those yields come in It seems like you do n't trend rents and I would imagine from the point you started those to the point they got fully leased the rents have probably moved to a dedescent amount,4,62,0,0.0,0.0,0.04838709677419355,0.0,0.016129032258064516,0.694622857,13.71,10169.15796,8,0.7407624890000001,2.6637,2013-Apr-30,WEC

Yes but as you look forward UOP is going to start to have a ramp up in I guess the big Brazilian project I mean in the margin guidance in {DATE} are you capturing the big ramp of what is probably a breakthrough profit project for UOP,2,47,0,0.0,0.0,0.02127659574468085,0.02127659574468085,0.0,1.216323718,13.52,10584.67968,8,0.424885652,1.6865400000000002,2013-May-01,OKE
Could you help us understand just on the COGS I guess following onto Adam 's question here as we look into {DATE} with some of the integration costs around Yahoo and I guess I 'm also wondering around kind of mix within EDD how much we should expect sort of what we have seen over the course of {DATE} be indicative of where gross margins are in the future or do we think we are on sort of a new kind of trajectory in those individual businesses,4,87,0,0.0,0.011494252873563218,0.011494252873563218,0.0,0.011494252873563218,1.216323718,13.52,10584.67968,8,0.424885652,1.6865400000000002,2013-May-01,OKE
Sounds complicated But anyways the restructuring {MONEY} that you 're going to spend how much of that is Beckman related and a pull forward of you know what you need to take out in costs and now you 're able business conditions are good enough that you can afford to do it How much of that is Beckman versus just general Danaher,3,62,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03225806451612903,0.03225806451612903,1.216323718,13.52,10584.67968,8,0.424885652,1.6865400000000002,2013-May-01,OKE
No that is very helpful Bob Thank you Then just to clarify does guidance also include the potential buybacks that are associated with the potential monetization of the Celera assets Or will this represent upside,4,35,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.216323718,13.52,10584.67968,8,0.424885652,1.6865400000000002,2013-May-01,OKE
The last quick question I 'd have you mentioned M&A and it sounded like bolt ons more than anything else Of course with the Advance CARQUEST deal one wonders if you 're kind of inspired to look at bigger deals I do n't know if there 's much left in Automotive of size But are you thinking now about perhaps a larger size transaction than you would have done in the US Or are we still talking primarily smaller deals,5,80,0,0.0,0.0125,0.0125,0.0,0.0125,1.839351979,13.52,22352.81832,4,1.229207923,1.73872,2013-May-01,DVN
Just following up on the last question and maybe focusing on the cash equity piece of the business it looks like your market share {DATE} came down again and then started to recover a little bit in {DATE} I want to get a sense of whether or not you have changed anything on the pricing side that 's leading to slightly better market share so far in {DATE},2,68,0,0.0,0.014705882352941176,0.014705882352941176,0.029411764705882353,0.014705882352941176,1.230669498,13.52,85474.067,7,0.81186974,0.34515,2013-May-01,CMCSA

Okay thanks for that Then to switch gears you talked about keeping some firepower for continued M&A and so the question there is I think the past you guys have talked about and maybe it was even {DATE} some potentially larger scale I think single asset but probably larger scale type deals that might be out there Do you still think that larger bigger assets are available or are things we 're looking at more opportunistic smaller scale and more like some of these independent hotel deals we 've seen around the sector recently,6,94,0,0.0,0.02127659574468085,0.031914893617021274,0.0,0.02127659574468085,2.226103057,13.52,13080.38864,4,1.387012247,1.06958,2013-May-01,CHK
Okay And then that the {CARDINAL} wells you mentioned Steve in the deep Utica your thoughts How far north I mean you have got obviously some interesting acreage all way up into Allegheny and given how successful CNX is obviously their Gaut well was all the way clear up into Westmoreland Just your thoughts on any ideas you can give us on those {CARDINAL} wells Will most of those be focused down around that Greene County area or will you take them all the way up to potentially as north as Allegheny,6,92,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.010869565217391304,0.0,2.226103057,13.52,13080.38864,4,1.387012247,1.06958,2013-May-01,CHK

And then I guess as a follow up to that you talked about state of the consumer Last time you had talked about where the higher end consumer was thinking about eating out less pulling in a little bit Has that continued with that higher end customer getting more skittish,3,50,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8958048890000001,14.49,20944.71126,8,1.145366611,1.33584,2013-May-02,PCG
Okay And then following up on that when you think about longer term the opportunities that you see to grow the agent count is the current pace sustainable over {DATE} And how much opportunity is there to grow before you view that as saturated,3,44,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045454545454545456,0.0,0.8958048890000001,14.49,20944.71126,8,1.145366611,1.33584,2013-May-02,PCG
Thanks very much Good job in terms of responding to the market I think historically you guys have always done well in terms of balancing the pace and price there Wondering talked {CARDINAL} basis points in terms of {DATE} margins Presumably some of the what you 're doing with the incentives were to generate sales that will be closing sorry the second calendar {DATE} But if we think about {DATE} here some of those will likely be coming through Should we expect more of a hit to margins in {DATE} from this impact,7,93,0,0.010752688172043012,0.0,0.010752688172043012,0.010752688172043012,0.010752688172043012,0.941692318,14.49,9668.91096,11,0.484029888,6.5,2013-May-02,KIM
Got it Okay And then just a follow up on the FX dynamic Really as it relates to your M&A plans the current kind of exchange rate picture would suggest that maybe some of the assets you are looking at overseas are perhaps less expensive So do you feel like the current rates environment give you a little more opportunity to be aggressive on M&A overseas,5,66,0,0.0,0.045454545454545456,0.045454545454545456,0.015151515151515152,0.0,1.846133182,14.49,8943.987640000001,11,2.554294696,5.56152,2013-May-02,LNC
Okay And then {CARDINAL} other follow up just on the wage discussion Can I infer from your comments that a wage increase was not necessarily in your guidance right now although it is something that you might contemplate and try to mitigate at some point in {DATE} not really in the guidance yet,3,53,0,0.0,0.018867924528301886,0.018867924528301886,0.0,0.0,0.868418915,14.49,9455.94219,11,0.383891762,0.45227,2013-May-02,MAC

Thanks And sorry for being tardy Chip sort of curious as I look at the liquidity business I guess that was most surprising relative to my expectation and again what we see in some of your competitors and even what we saw on the retail fund flow data can you give us a little background on what 's happening there Is it a non U.S. issue Is it a performance issue What sort of plans are there to build that business,7,81,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.720233276,14.49,19388.45136,8,0.851986777,0.32626,2013-May-02,PPL
Craig Hallum Capital Group I have a quick question Do you think Steve that you 'll have a decent opportunity for mix up in {DATE} as far as high capacity drives within the desktop or do you think that will follow historical standards and be more of a {DATE} event,3,50,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02,0.02,1.510284467,14.49,7267.1599,11,1.578834699,0.98733,2013-May-02,UNM
Yes I 'm just trying to if you look at your guidance on the {CARDINAL} core businesses I 'm trying to correlate the {MONEY} versus what ISG is {DATE} So if you could give us a sense for kind of the magnitude of revenues that will be discontinued ops out of ISG,2,52,0,0.0,0.019230769230769232,0.019230769230769232,0.0,0.019230769230769232,1.510284467,14.49,7267.1599,11,1.578834699,0.98733,2013-May-02,UNM
Okay And can you talk about your view on OCC moving into {DATE} I know obviously you expect it to be up and volatile in {DATE} But just in general how you see the pressures in the market playing out versus I guess overseas demand and shipping capacity and everything else,4,51,0,0.0,0.0,0.0196078431372549,0.0,0.0196078431372549,0.7098287329999999,14.49,15540.25752,8,1.0274936,1.1449200000000002,2013-May-02,XEL

Thanks Good {TIME} Andrew I was wondering if you could actually specify a little bit more I mean you talked about workover being the first sort of threshold of activity adjustment Regionally speaking what areas should we expect to see the first rates of adjustment in terms of spending growth to take place internationally,4,54,0,0.0,0.018518518518518517,0.018518518518518517,0.018518518518518517,0.0,1.5000129830000002,14.49,5648.44994,12,0.686114824,2.57528,2013-May-02,PWR
If I could be if I could kind of push on that though I mean what in the {PERCENT} what 's the what kind of magnitude are you assuming There 's got to be a pricing assumption in there Can you share something on that with us,3,47,0,0.0,0.0425531914893617,0.0851063829787234,0.0,0.0,2.192200544,14.49,8474.12906,6,0.181566903,3.11017,2013-May-02,TDC
In your guidance of a {MONEY} to {MONEY} I 'm assuming you 've got some share count dilution in there from the {MONEY} in equity issuance you plan to do Can you let us know what that might be,2,39,0,0.0,0.02564102564102564,0.05128205128205128,0.0,0.0,1.345489247,14.49,14977.3884,9,0.4443287520000001,2.97918,2013-May-02,CAH
First I know that earlier in {DATE} you had some disconnect between your shipment volumes and consumer take away related to retailer inventory de stocking When you look at the overall soup season as a whole did consumption by your measures pretty much track sales Or was there any net effect for {DATE},3,53,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.221796587,14.49,10430.24982,8,1.0260954,3.2827800000000003,2013-May-02,CNP

First of all the higher tax rate in health is that sort of fixable by restructuring comp or should we just assume that kind of rate going forward,1,28,0,0.0,0.0,0.03571428571428571,0.0,0.03571428571428571,0.724150049,14.49,7553.37142,11,0.189380649,2.88667,2013-May-02,FRT
Okay great And then just quickly if I take a look at average written premium per policy the year over year growth decelerated in {DATE} Is that just a function of just getting more competitive out there from a rate perspective at Allstate Is there something else that I am missing,4,51,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0196078431372549,0.0,2.204216037,14.49,8770.0902,4,0.552254893,1.9929,2013-May-02,CXO
I had a question on first slide {CARDINAL} on the effect of low interest rates And was wondering how much is that coming from lower investment income in the Property and Casualty insurance businesses,2,34,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.029411764705882353,2.204216037,14.49,8770.0902,4,0.552254893,1.9929,2013-May-02,CXO
Thanks very much I have a {CARDINAL} part question so I will ask the first part and then follow up The first part is that while we and I think most others probably under modeled the warehouse sales in {DATE} which would explain the mix impact on margin did you see any likelihood of a {MONEY} quarter in that segment or were you surprised by the magnitude,3,67,0,0.0,0.0,0.029850746268656716,0.0,0.014925373134328358,2.204216037,14.49,8770.0902,4,0.552254893,1.9929,2013-May-02,CXO
Okay okay My second question in the past it seems that onboard spend has been almost a leading indicator to higher ticket pricing Do you think we may be seeing some of that especially on the onboard part,3,38,0,0.0,0.05263157894736842,0.07894736842105263,0.02631578947368421,0.02631578947368421,1.251905981,13.59,7558.096,3,0.314997207,4.53575,2013-May-03,NWL

Thanks for that Here 's a third question on the guidance On the NGL production growth of {PERCENT} to {PERCENT} is any of that driven by a change in processing contracts and reporting the NGLs as opposed to leaving it in the gas stream,3,44,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045454545454545456,1.145425301,12.66,16415.1,11,0.373535982,1.46276,2013-May-07,VNO

Thanks a question on brodalumab I 'm assuming {CARDINAL} Phase III trials are designed to show superiority with Stelara in psoriasis and the fact that Novartis issued a superior efficacy over Enbrel with their antibody Why did you use Stelara as a compare versus Enbrel,3,45,0,0.0,0.0,0.022222222222222223,0.022222222222222223,0.022222222222222223,1.085850018,12.66,6372.56319,5,0.229921211,1.51274,2013-May-07,IFF

Does the impairment you guys took on commercial or the one you will take given that extra cash surplus does that make it easier to think about monetizing international because you have a better offset to maybe any repatriation cash you 'd have to deal with,1,46,0,0.0,0.021739130434782608,0.021739130434782608,0.043478260869565216,0.021739130434782608,0.798342453,12.66,7940.43029,9,0.397793063,0.59068,2013-May-07,HSIC

Okay And then back to the Caribbean correct me if I 'm wrong here it seems that your tone on the promotions and again you said that overall since {DATE} your outlook for the Caribbean has weakened a little bit while other areas of the globe strengthened But between {DATE} market versus the {DATE} market in particular it seems like maybe {DATE} as a whole your comment there has become a little bit more promotional and or has that is the promotional activity really intensified even more so in the {CARDINAL},3,91,0,0.0,0.01098901098901099,0.03296703296703297,0.01098901098901099,0.02197802197802198,0.98634763,12.66,18476.78288,8,1.127989589,2.417,2013-May-07,FE
Got it And then just {CARDINAL} more on the OE side in bis jet you 're running about flat in {DATE} little bit down if I look at {DATE} in composite You mentioned the moving pieces Any reason to think that the trajectory changes meaningfully either for better or for worse as you look out over {DATE} into {DATE},4,59,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01694915254237288,0.01694915254237288,1.548393903,12.55,14941.72336,6,0.431851531,5.8361800000000015,2013-May-14,A

Couple of questions Todd first for you on {DATE} guidance given your comments on hernia it is fair to assume we 're not going to see the kind of sequential expansion to much of a degree until {DATE} or maybe until the hernia business starts to recover That 's the first question And then the second question is on oncology just to follow up on the last question has there been any new competition coming on the power side You know is there just sort of the unit growth slowing a little bit Or have you seen anybody enter the market at all in power PICCs or ports and take share,6,111,0,0.0,0.009009009009009009,0.018018018018018018,0.0,0.04504504504504504,1.720913254,13.82,14257.8056,9,0.140484015,0.37171,2013-May-23,ROST

Then finally on a couple of unique or interesting services seem to be appearing up on your website which are nontraditional on the industrial side but tied I guess maybe towards a little bit more towards the chemical component Are you willing to talk a little bit about some of these additional opportunities you 're developing,2,56,0,0.0,0.03571428571428571,0.03571428571428571,0.017857142857142856,0.0,1.345171228,20.11,19666.50576,12,0.797629079,2.00283,2013-Jun-25,CCL
Okay there 's none there Okay that 's helpful And then switching gears just to headcount for a second When you think about the level of employees you have furloughed at this point when you look out at the weakness that you 're expecting for {DATE} in the domestic side of the business on coal do you feel like you 're at the right point there Do you need to take any further steps or is headcount based on what Fred has said kind of should be flattish going forward overall for the business,5,94,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.010638297872340425,1.345171228,20.11,19666.50576,12,0.797629079,2.00283,2013-Jun-25,CCL
Great I was just trying to figure out the timing for the sake of AOF because that can provide if it comes {DATE} provide a pretty good continued {DATE} benefit I guess the second question I think you just answered this but a clarification You have a fairly well not fairly you have a very healthy balance sheet So is this an either or if you 're considering M&A list from a client 's perspective not allowed to do a buyback and if you continue to look at M&A does it preclude a buyback for a long time,6,98,0,0.0,0.0,0.01020408163265306,0.030612244897959183,0.02040816326530612,1.005269221,17.21,13824.485019999998,12,0.134300295,0.78422,2013-Jun-27,PAYX
Hey just a quick one on your guidance Your sales forecast you brought down but you 're reiterating EPS What line items went up since your EPS did n't change And also can you talk about whether the {CARDINAL} {PERCENT} {PERCENT} tax rate is what we should expect the rest of {DATE},4,52,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.553775137,14.21,32550.277680000007,9,0.07683728299999999,0.4794600000000001,2013-Jul-11,YUM
My first question can you just give us some color on what you think the SG&A ratio for {DATE} is as a percentage of sales,1,25,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04,1.553775137,14.21,32550.277680000007,9,0.07683728299999999,0.4794600000000001,2013-Jul-11,YUM
And so on a run rate are we looking at maybe the margin compression going away by the end of {CARDINAL} Or would it take a little longer What 's your thoughts there on timing,3,35,0,0.0,0.02857142857142857,0.02857142857142857,0.0,0.0,1.327963154,14.01,208411.3346,11,1.165940813,2.7742,2013-Jul-12,JPM
So your reduction and your {DATE} price mix guidance if I 'm interpreting it right is just reflective of what happened in {DATE} that 's not a go forward Thinks are different at guidance,2,34,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.937614816,13.84,5871.36,1,0.432037976,0.76951,2013-Jul-15,CTAS

Okay And then a brief follow up It 's not part shortages holding anything up right now and then just on Casco that {MONEY} of accretion for {DATE} should we expect that to normalize to maybe like a {MONEY} plus range as we head into {DATE} per {CARDINAL},3,48,0,0.0,0.020833333333333332,0.020833333333333332,0.0,0.020833333333333332,1.6428838369999998,13.79,16670.32935,5,0.555513727,0.04726,2013-Jul-16,MOS

Got it And just related does it put any pressure on the comp book for certain types of customers Meaning if I have a business that has a lot of delivery vans or something and obviously if someone gets in an accident on the job I assume there is a comp payout too So does that create any inflation pressure on comp as well,4,64,0,0.0,0.0,0.015625,0.0,0.015625,2.468243282,14.42,7704.91915,3,0.444784172,1.52587,2013-Jul-17,TXT

Hello guys I just have a sort of a high level question you covered a lot of the detail on the call But when you think about the acceleration in the development pipeline higher volumes a bigger overall investment maybe it 's not supply or absorption or job creation that causes you to pause maybe it 's the disruption the capital markets potentially higher costs of capital down the road How do you weigh those {CARDINAL} macro factors relative to deciding to move forward at an even higher volume of product deliveries,4,92,0,0.0,0.021739130434782608,0.021739130434782608,0.0,0.021739130434782608,1.25186252,13.78,17265.65368,12,0.335673119,0.75139,2013-Jul-18,OMC

As you commented that you do n't see any change in life sciences could you kind of decouple your consumables and instrument business Because during the earnings season we heard some instrument manufacturers talk about that some large pharma companies have had some lumpy cycles especially with {DATE} spend What did you see in your business and what are your expectations in {DATE},3,63,0,0.0,0.015873015873015872,0.015873015873015872,0.0,0.0,1.12345688,13.78,16860.2715,11,0.993234965,18.7337,2013-Jul-18,FITB
Do we think we 'll get more rigs into the field either in the Piceance where you are a little bit higher than your {CARDINAL} and whether you will get more into the Barnett now that you 've got a little bit more acreage,1,44,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.12345688,13.78,16860.2715,11,0.993234965,18.7337,2013-Jul-18,FITB
Bringing the loans down is that anything more than just not making new loans and allowing the portfolio to pay off over time,1,23,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.368885051,13.78,13758.39223,3,0.468742804,2.31395,2013-Jul-18,DOV
Okay And as my follow up you guys have talked I think in {DATE} about acquisitions as a potential use of cash And if these acquisitions are to go through do you think you 'll be able to still support the dividend,3,42,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.023809523809523808,0.0,1.368885051,13.78,13758.39223,3,0.468742804,2.31395,2013-Jul-18,DOV
Okay You also mentioned and I do n't know if I completely understood it and it was Dan Eggers question with respect to steel costs I think it was {CARDINAL} it sounded to me like the cost might be lower Could you just elaborate on that,5,46,0,0.0,0.043478260869565216,0.043478260869565216,0.0,0.021739130434782608,1.208861729,13.78,47388.08587,6,0.49481867,1.0255299999999998,2013-Jul-18,DHR
In China is there any natural advantage to {DATE} falling in {DATE} as opposed to {DATE} or is it immaterial which month it falls in,1,25,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04,0.04,2.114477692,13.77,9450.04542,2,0.5299661,0.26651,2013-Jul-19,WHR
Okay Is there industry a lot of industry activity around you Obviously it 's {CARDINAL} rigs in the basin it 's hard to believe there is a lot of acreage without production on it,3,34,0,0.0,0.0,0.029411764705882353,0.0,0.0,2.114477692,13.77,9450.04542,2,0.5299661,0.26651,2013-Jul-19,WHR
Thanks for taking my question You 've reduced your CapEx to {MONEY} If this linger on longer can you reduce that further Or is this maintenance level,4,27,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037037037037037035,2.114477692,13.77,9450.04542,2,0.5299661,0.26651,2013-Jul-19,WHR
And how do we reconcile these comments that are pretty bullish in export coal with what seem to be production cuts from a number of coal companies out there Is it just because of these unique attributes of the coal Is that really possible,3,44,0,0.0,0.022727272727272728,0.022727272727272728,0.0,0.0,1.299588692,13.77,31970.6472,11,0.945194462,2.27321,2013-Jul-19,STT
Got it And then just a follow up also on that topic if we consider the implications of this change in land strategy division by division which division is it having most impact on So for example were land sales concentrated more in Centex or Del Webb let 's say or the Pulte side of things And so how is it how is it how would you think it would shape the strategy in the divisions going forward,5,78,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.936058787,13.77,9296.17692,3,0.165189401,2.3148,2013-Jul-19,COL
Okay and most of that how much do you intend to I think you mentioned most of that you intend to use for buybacks but how much would you want to keep just as a cushion out of that amount,2,40,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.800465556,13.77,12876.97034,12,0.433414669,0.64977,2013-Jul-19,KSU
The slide where you talked about dividend growth of {PERCENT} expected over {DATE} Jim should we assume that that basically moves in line with EPS growth Or how should we be thinking about that relative to EPS growth,2,38,0,0.0,0.0,0.02631578947368421,0.0,0.0,1.5363897030000002,12.54,5634.55035,11,1.249097824,0.95584,2013-Jul-22,ZION
All right So any idea what that translates into in rough cash flow,2,13,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.5363897030000002,12.54,5634.55035,11,1.249097824,0.95584,2013-Jul-22,ZION
Can I start I 'm trying to understand the line in the guidance which basically calls for continued refinement of products under fair play Are you looking to eliminate other fees on products Is that what that 's saying,3,39,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.286930333,12.54,38264.25196,3,0.151664511,1.10416,2013-Jul-22,KMB
Thank you That 's helpful Any sense of I mean at this point how quickly you would assume that piece of expansion kind of getting from that {PERCENT} to {PERCENT},3,30,0,0.0,0.0,0.03333333333333333,0.0,0.0,1.326962865,12.29,20453.178,2,0.420598986,2.69196,2013-Jul-23,PCAR

Thanks guys Good {TIME} Ted and Keith you 've added some pretty good {CARDINAL} color Obviously I think the {CARDINAL} color is more in line because of the softer book to bill in {CARDINAL} but I 'm wondering anything stand out for {CARDINAL} that we should bear in mind Ted,4,50,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04,0.0,1.038559247,12.29,4795.01332,12,0.367750619,0.7154,2013-Jul-23,TSS
Thanks for taking my question My first question is regarding the foundry investment {DATE} I just wanted to make sure I understand the linearity of it a little bit better You mentioned it stronger in {DATE} Just giving the timing of the end consumer devices and the ramp associated with it is it fair to think that the strength would be more stronger in {DATE} than {DATE},5,67,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05970149253731343,0.029850746268656716,1.387464274,12.29,387301.3561,6,0.210768375,0.49985,2013-Jul-23,AAPL
Great And {CARDINAL} other quick question guys I do n't know if Don or Alan or Steve want to field this but do I understand that the latest drop down to WPZ pretax the WMB may have been {CARDINAL} times EBITDA and after tax maybe {CARDINAL} times And does that seem a little low for fee based business And how does that correlate to maybe future dropdowns and how you 'd envision pricing,4,73,0,0.0,0.0410958904109589,0.0410958904109589,0.0136986301369863,0.0136986301369863,1.276311177,12.29,4421.5296,3,0.453105644,0.64378,2013-Jul-23,AVY
Last question and I will defer to others You noted in {DATE} that you took some production down to get the inventories a little bit more in line Can you help us reconcile that with the fact that the inventories are still both on a year on year and sequential basis moving considerably higher than sales are,3,57,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03508771929824561,1.4600547469999998,12.29,3043.22232,11,0.444213883,1.06158,2013-Jul-23,CNC
Okay In terms of the Atoka you talked about deepening the wells I think you were saying {MONEY} additional costs for roughly a {QUANTITY} deepening That sounded a little pricey to me Can you walk us through the costs there Is that all pretty much frac or how are you getting to that cost,6,54,0,0.0,0.0,0.018518518518518517,0.0,0.0,0.984237988,12.29,93869.82511,3,0.343893126,2.9853,2013-Jul-23,UTX
How should we think about CapEx as merged entity Obviously tw had a much lighter level of capital intensity Is it fair to think about the blended there multiple their percent your percent less that CapEx energy number so getting to sort of a mid teens number,3,47,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.339904058,12.29,24952.824,11,0.444237152,1.2245,2013-Jul-23,DFS
Okay And Tim can you give,2,6,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.141007295,12.29,9032.37208,6,0.194964009,7.334860000000001,2013-Jul-23,WAT
Okay And then just so would it be safe to assume that the subprime part you have written down very very heavily and the non subprime part you have written down slightly Would that be a way to think about it,3,41,0,0.0,0.0,0.024390243902439025,0.0,0.0,1.141007295,12.29,9032.37208,6,0.194964009,7.334860000000001,2013-Jul-23,WAT
Got it John how are you feeling about the overall sales force productivity all the folks you have hired over {DATE},2,21,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047619047619047616,1.141007295,12.29,9032.37208,6,0.194964009,7.334860000000001,2013-Jul-23,WAT
Then just a little bit more color on your outlook which is appreciated So your core margin I guess that would be excluding First Charter your core margin should that go higher from here,2,34,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.07550623,12.29,19235.05882,4,1.26832242,1.6689599999999998,2013-Jul-23,VLO
{CARDINAL} last housekeeping question before I stop hogging the call up here Keith given the uptick at the {CARDINAL} time stock comp charges that you guys booked in {DATE} can we expect stock comp levels to more or less revert to sort of the previous guidance levels,1,47,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02127659574468085,1.122413522,12.66,27787.31058,1,0.249603359,0.3628,2013-Jul-24,RAI^G17
Right Okay Fair enough Just {CARDINAL} more if I may with Gary Can you discuss the notching impact or the additional capital call requirement that would happen as BBB or if BBB credits get downgraded to below investment grade Is there a rule of thumb we can use to think about the additional capital requirement that that kind of rating move would have,6,63,0,0.0,0.015873015873015872,0.015873015873015872,0.0,0.015873015873015872,0.895755176,12.66,34602.75,5,0.210719399,0.39027,2013-Jul-24,PX
Yes sure So on slide {CARDINAL} when you talk about the commercial charge offs looks like it was a bit higher {DATE} and obviously lower {DATE} Were there any reversals or recoveries that happened in {DATE} that would lead to the lower number or is {CARDINAL} basis points roughly a good fairly clean number,3,54,0,0.0,0.0,0.018518518518518517,0.018518518518518517,0.0,0.895755176,12.66,34602.75,5,0.210719399,0.39027,2013-Jul-24,PX
Yes thanks for my question I have a couple of them {CARDINAL} is Mike what percentage of your orders do you think in {DATE} are capacity driven and where do you think it is going to be in {DATE} or maybe {DATE},3,42,0,0.0,0.023809523809523808,0.023809523809523808,0.0,0.023809523809523808,1.490282953,12.66,16075.71,6,0.536379408,1.95118,2013-Jul-24,WDC

Should we expect the supplies line to grow in the back {DATE},1,12,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.3556474319999998,12.66,8517.155359999999,9,0.167137045,1.68731,2013-Jul-24,TSCO
Okay So sometimes your competitors talk about some market share gains You do n't seem to be seeing any pressure on your market share is that correct,3,27,0,0.0,0.037037037037037035,0.037037037037037035,0.037037037037037035,0.0,0.990525589,12.66,10200.54112,12,0.237075469,2.00103,2013-Jul-24,SRCL
Just some follow ups on the Geismar proposed drop down you mentioned in the release of taking units back Is the idea that this would potentially be solely WPZ units going up to WMB to fund this,2,37,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.990525589,12.66,10200.54112,12,0.237075469,2.00103,2013-Jul-24,SRCL
So would this be obviously just broadly speaking analogous to what you have in the Bakken where you have got a dolomitic sandstone near a shale that tends to be more productive Am I reading in a little bit too much into it,2,43,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.182404059,12.66,32238.56904,6,0.7681406390000001,1.13383,2013-Jul-24,TMO
Spencer when you say that acquisitions should be accretive do you mean accretive only to earnings Or would you consider acquiring an attractively priced lease up situation that may not immediately be accretive to earnings,2,35,0,0.0,0.02857142857142857,0.02857142857142857,0.0,0.0,1.65654688,12.66,3904.72261,11,1.9152697,6.72357,2013-Jul-24,ETFC
Okay but the giving you if they were to say that after {DATE} hypothetically if they come back on {DATE} and say okay you can go ahead and restart you still have to then subsequent to that get an approval of your specific plan before you can actually restart Is that correct,2,52,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.65654688,12.66,3904.72261,11,1.9152697,6.72357,2013-Jul-24,ETFC
Great And lastly if I could I know you had benefited from some distressed Vin cargos that were in the market {DATE} Are you still seeing some volume there Or have they been pulled back given Mace 's back up and running,4,42,0,0.0,0.023809523809523808,0.023809523809523808,0.047619047619047616,0.023809523809523808,1.220293263,12.66,9421.20075,6,0.119974033,0.96748,2013-Jul-24,LLTC
Okay And cash flow for {DATE} the net income conversion do you anticipate getting to a full net income conversion {DATE} And if not is it a temporal issue that goes back in {CARDINAL},3,34,0,0.0,0.0,0.029411764705882353,0.0,0.0,1.220293263,12.66,9421.20075,6,0.119974033,0.96748,2013-Jul-24,LLTC

Just on the legal front not sure exactly what you can say I 'll give it a shot here Does the lack of a settlement so far with the government reflect the DC shutdown or more the fact that you 're still negotiating or a combination of both any comment there,2,51,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0392156862745098,2.02470768,12.66,6257.35255,6,0.161398853,4.3216,2013-Jul-24,FFIV
Just a real quick one about the potential changes by FAS B could you just explain how the accounting would work on that It seems like there would be a reserve build necessary necessary but what do you move over I guess can you help us understand the exact accounting behind it,4,52,0,0.0,0.019230769230769232,0.038461538461538464,0.0,0.0,2.05523864,12.66,6995.0282400000015,3,0.5440203570000001,1.5014299999999998,2013-Jul-24,FBHS
Good {TIME} A couple questions Based on the ALJ filing {TIME} and the timing of the comments etc could you give us a sense of when the earliest we could actually get an ALJ proposed decision and then a final order,3,41,0,0.0,0.04878048780487805,0.04878048780487805,0.024390243902439025,0.024390243902439025,2.078411906,13.18,3586.61008,4,1.024916764,0.5939300000000001,2013-Jul-25,NFX
Good {TIME} Thanks for taking my questions Just wanted to dive into the Cana NGL volume versus price breakdown a little bit more There 's a slide on slide {CARDINAL} that discusses the current production breakdown {PERCENT} gas {PERCENT} oil Does that apply to the I guess {CARDINAL} a day average in {DATE} the {CARDINAL} a day exit rate and the current rate of around I think it was {CARDINAL} Are those the right volumes to be looking at,7,79,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.012658227848101266,0.0379746835443038,1.328644385,13.18,27066.57002,9,0.29983368,6.78052,2013-Jul-25,MCK
I ca n't guarantee a logical follow up But I 'll try First of all Will in terms of you saying that the business is stabilizing are you referring to average {DATE} sales dollars flattening out or are you talking about year to {DATE} change in average {DATE} sales that sort of {DATE} rate,3,54,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.018518518518518517,0.0,1.6536100319999998,13.18,7979.832590000001,12,1.117035487,3.92812,2013-Jul-25,RCL

Thanks Hi Good {TIME} A couple questions John maybe I will start with the final question usually In terms of the outlook you said you expect to close strongly despite the fewer shipping days Should we take that as an increase in earnings {DATE} versus {DATE} And just for the record what was {DATE} from an EPS standpoint from your vantage point,8,62,0,0.016129032258064516,0.016129032258064516,0.016129032258064516,0.03225806451612903,0.03225806451612903,0.8621237140000001,13.18,6451.8931200000015,11,0.89579586,2.02834,2013-Jul-25,TMK

Lastly on the guidance You guys had {DATE} here You kept the guidance I know the end market environment is still a bit challenging but given the fact that the {CARDINAL} guidance {DATE} at least from an EPS perspective looks to be at least flat What are you seeing or which specific businesses are you most intently focused on that keep you reserved Obviously industrial is an obvious one but aside from industrial to keep you a bit more reserved from being a bit more aggressive on the guidance,7,89,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.011235955056179775,1.1322660690000002,13.18,50050.754,9,0.134736942,1.8734,2013-Jul-25,SBUX

Right And although it 's very early in the {PERCENT} reward REDcard performance to see what the mix effect is but based on what you saw in Kansas City in terms of how people are utilizing the card would you say that they were using it to buy more of the food items or was it more broadly spread across the store,2,62,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.016129032258064516,0.0,1.7352103559999998,13.18,12258.94815,8,0.59523255,0.26093,2013-Jul-25,EQT

Good {TIME} and thanks for the update Richard Yanacocha had a pretty good result going through the mill The milling rate was well above what we thought on the grades What should we be thinking about that going forward,4,39,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05128205128205128,0.0,0.8843297590000001,13.18,7320.33347,12,0.331627391,2.39662,2013-Jul-25,EFX
A quick question when you look at the opportunity on field services any sense of bracketing what you think the potential growth CapEx opportunity is there as some of these projects come to fruition,1,34,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058823529411764705,0.029411764705882353,1.260801478,12.97,11871.7732,11,1.173110578,3.3656,2013-Jul-26,PFG

And then just as a follow up the way we calculate organic growth is similar exactly how you do it We think ECP adds {CARDINAL} to {CARDINAL} percentage points to growth in {DATE} which would imply that your North American business is growing at a slower pace Is that the right way to look at it And if so why would North America growth rates have slowed,4,67,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.029850746268656716,1.223805729,12.72,12992.15277,6,0.399823008,1.557,2013-Jul-29,ROP
Thanks for letting me ask a question and congratulations on {DATE} results Paul given that {DATE} tends to be {CARDINAL} of your seasonally stronger {DATE} and as we move into the back {CARDINAL} of the calendar year some of your end market exposure is going to seasonally weaker quarters how are you guys thinking about seasonality for {DATE} Is it just irrelevant and being trumped by what happened to the macro the back {DATE} or can you give me some color there,3,82,0,0.0,0.0,0.012195121951219513,0.012195121951219513,0.024390243902439025,0.862157305,13.39,19545.0381,12,0.52998245,0.80274,2013-Jul-30,WM

Understood I guess switching over to the big gas kind of things Tony you mentioned in the beginning the gas outlook is challenging the power price outlook is challenging As you all look out {DATE} and you think about the size of your retail business at {QUANTITY} over time which is I guess {PERCENT} above fleet output do you see that staying fairly stable or given the gas and power look as you see it out in {DATE} or {DATE} is there a potential that that retail business would need to get a bit smaller than the million megawatt hours,3,100,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01,0.02,1.332082563,13.39,12646.12245,6,0.190443573,4.61067,2013-Jul-30,ROK

Steve maybe I can start with you on the equipment side On the traditional versus the high tech breakout that you gave on the growth rates can you just remind us kind of what percentage as you fill in buckets of traditional versus high tech what percentage of your North American dental equipment would fall into traditional versus high tech,2,60,0,0.0,0.016666666666666666,0.016666666666666666,0.0,0.0,1.45609237,13.39,20507.5248,11,0.410398157,0.37687,2013-Jul-30,GGP

And as you evaluate the M&A opportunities would you likely use MPC as a source of funding or do you feel like MPLX is large enough at this point to do sizable M&A as you think about the trade off between drops and M&A,1,44,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.022727272727272728,0.0,1.500572331,13.39,22701.61971,3,1.158780469,1.08579,2013-Jul-30,GLW
I 'll add my congratulations on the progress and the good results for {DATE} Perhaps I 'll take a question on the pipeline George since you 're on the call On {CARDINAL} you moved the time line up which is encouraging Do you think it 's feasible that you could get through Phase III in {DATE} in the southern and northern hemisphere And related to that is it looking as though this is a product that 's suitable for full term infants are you going to focus on the preemies as your predecessor did,6,94,0,0.0,0.02127659574468085,0.02127659574468085,0.031914893617021274,0.010638297872340425,1.671397725,13.39,14032.26342,11,2.233955199,0.88192,2013-Jul-30,HIG
Just a question around capital allocation Obviously the buyback spend has tailed off in the second {CARDINAL} I guess in line with the initial plan for {DATE} M&A now stepped up so is that just a sort of the vagaries of short term timing or is there a more fundamental shift in approach on how you are using the cash,3,60,0,0.0,0.0,0.016666666666666666,0.0,0.016666666666666666,1.261448587,13.39,12426.8402,7,0.28893578,2.43758,2013-Jul-30,DISCA

Fair enough Then just looking at all your actual savings so far it sounds like you saved {MONEY} {DATE} with {PERCENT} in head count reductions since {DATE} and given where fuel costs are {DATE} What 's your expectation for savings in {CARDINAL},3,42,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.867123862,13.45,21136.80991,4,0.595486974,0.07711,2013-Aug-01,PXD
But would I be overly optimistic to suggest that you are really only running at {PERCENT} of your current of your possible capacity at current volume levels,1,27,0,0.0,0.07407407407407407,0.07407407407407407,0.037037037037037035,0.0,1.233234246,13.45,7824.1284,9,0.328840036,0.7107,2013-Aug-01,LKQ
I will also add my congratulations great job Another follow up on the gross margins obviously very impressive in {DATE} Can you remind us obviously as the freight benefit mitigates in the back {CARDINAL} can you remind us of the gross margin benefit you had in and of {DATE},4,49,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08163265306122448,0.0,1.233234246,13.45,7824.1284,9,0.328840036,0.7107,2013-Aug-01,LKQ

Good {TIME} Congratulations first of all to both Steve and Arne Happy retirement and I guess congratulations as well to Tony and Andy on new responsibilities First off on BETSS C I understand that maybe you do n't have perfect visibility on either that or what the Marine Corps is doing But the Army is asking for {MONEY} in funding in the government fiscal {CARDINAL} budget for BETSS C. And then I think it 's going to ask for something like {MONEY} in the pending Afghanistan supplemental appropriations Do you have a sense of what kind of content there might be And maybe if you can talk about the RAID component of that and any other content you might have as well,8,122,0,0.0,0.03278688524590164,0.040983606557377046,0.02459016393442623,0.0,1.449605695,13.45,12932.75928,4,0.923691918,4.82971,2013-Aug-01,MUR

And then when you look at your advertising base on the Cooking Channel is that is that mostly the same advertisers that are on Food Or are you seeing some some new or different advertisers on Cooking,2,37,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.915992641,13.45,6131.13536,12,0.654390304,1.69826,2013-Aug-01,VMC
Hi good {TIME} Also a couple questions I guess a different question on guidance If you look at your CapEx guidance previous to current where the difference would really be in Savvis looks like you 're bringing guidance by {MONEY} which I think is a little bit more than what Savvis was guiding for {DATE} So I wonder if you talk about what 's involved with the CapEx increase beyond Savvis And within that are there expectations Have you made any decisions on bringing IPTV into the Qwest markets,7,89,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.011235955056179775,0.02247191011235955,1.062291292,13.45,14892.30805,8,1.0274936,0.75748,2013-Aug-01,XEL
I think before you talked quite a bit about macro softness impact would have on the revenue line Can you tell us potentially plans to focus on OpEx reduction to defend margins or EPS and a degrading revenue line Is there some absent margin number that you really do not want corporate HP numbers to get below,3,57,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03508771929824561,1.062291292,13.45,14892.30805,8,1.0274936,0.75748,2013-Aug-01,XEL
Okay And what sort of programs do you have in place right now in order to achieve I guess the nearest hurdle right is {PERCENT} by {DATE},3,27,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037037037037037035,0.0,0.832768808,13.45,416847.75,4,0.522094167,3.506,2013-Aug-01,XOM
Okay okay That 's fair And then this Midlands can I ask you so how much of accretion should we expect {DATE} I mean there was a pretty strong accretion in {DATE} What is accretion level expected {DATE} can I ask,5,41,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.024390243902439025,0.0,1.309635284,13.45,22206.61126,11,0.639314959,3.0129200000000003,2013-Aug-01,CI
Right right but those are the biggest absolute numbers But so as we think forward beyond {DATE} is R&D at Cessna now likely at sort of a plateau level or near a plateau level,2,34,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.043397482,13.45,10636.1146,8,1.0260954,1.46928,2013-Aug-01,CNP
Okay great Thanks Second it looks like the aftermarket auto parts business is doing pretty well but we keep seeing continued weakness in the tire replacement market in the U.S. So what do you think is the disconnect there and why are people buying certain replacement auto parts but not tires,4,51,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0196078431372549,0.0196078431372549,1.227416481,13.45,16241.67835,8,1.063816846,2.71326,2013-Aug-01,EIX
Obviously you did a perfect job of repositioning inventory to take advantage of the weather and such Was wondering even as you chased a strong comp did you miss sales would you say during {DATE} Is there some way to measure how much sales you did miss it that is the case,3,52,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057692307692307696,0.038461538461538464,1.896889319,12.94,8792.069520000001,1,0.647258793,8.74673,2013-Aug-02,MHK
Okay Then in terms of SG&A I think on the last call and in previous calls you have talked about being able to leverage your leverage point for expenses at {PERCENT} I guess in {DATE} you did n't necessarily leverage or hardly levered with the higher comp and then for {DATE} you are not talking about it too much So are you seeing a higher level of expense or is that leverage point changing at all,4,76,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.013157894736842105,0.0,1.29753189,12.94,6486.873000000001,8,1.094639405,0.54709,2013-Aug-02,PNW
Okay And then on the restructuring if you had to allocate the expected {MONEY} of benefits that you anticipate for {DATE} to your segments how much would you anticipate falling into merchant how much in electronics and performance materials and how much outside those {CARDINAL} segments,2,46,0,0.0,0.0,0.043478260869565216,0.0,0.021739130434782608,1.646313876,12.94,14029.243019999998,4,0.348309235,0.53901,2013-Aug-02,SWN
And then in terms of your capacity utilization and your total shutdown days for {DATE} and perhaps how you 're looking at the rest of {DATE} what would you need to see before you started to push that capacity utilization higher,1,41,0,0.0,0.024390243902439025,0.024390243902439025,0.0,0.024390243902439025,1.19747367,12.94,31660.85208,7,0.273891342,0.37303,2013-Aug-02,VIAB
With the new allocation system going in {DATE} let 's say Would that end up being something that you could be more aggressive with having more information and being able to allocate it better,2,34,0,0.0,0.029411764705882353,0.029411764705882353,0.058823529411764705,0.0,1.19747367,12.94,31660.85208,7,0.273891342,0.37303,2013-Aug-02,VIAB
And you ca n't really comment on the trajectory on pricing with the model change I guess,1,17,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.121005842,12.94,5960.94828,8,1.040148403,0.83105,2013-Aug-02,LNT
Question for Steve If I heard you correctly you said that you will be filing with the Commission the updated schedule by {DATE} Is that in relation to missing the milestone with at Unit Or is that a function of your expectation that you will reach a settlement with the Consortium by then Or both Are those potentially {CARDINAL} separate filings What 's the strategy around that,7,67,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.014925373134328358,1.121005842,12.94,5960.94828,8,1.040148403,0.83105,2013-Aug-02,LNT
Okay So there 's a shot and you 'll find out in the course in {DATE} that some of the CapEx may actually get moved out to {DATE},2,28,0,0.0,0.03571428571428571,0.03571428571428571,0.0,0.0,1.475228479,12.94,4292.5545200000015,11,0.21491069,2.12505,2013-Aug-02,AIV
Good {TIME} thank you I was looking at slide {CARDINAL} for a question here The slide {CARDINAL} where you have the ROE sensitivities could you walk real quickly through which of those have the opportunity to realize those changes in {DATE} or {CARDINAL} Obviously Minnesota electric I would assume you have an ROE proposal there What other jurisdictions there would have the opportunity to go plus or minus on that ROE,5,71,0,0.0,0.014084507042253521,0.028169014084507043,0.04225352112676056,0.014084507042253521,0.942013645,12.94,8987.8776,5,0.34042647299999995,0.93872,2013-Aug-02,CHD
This is regarding your {DATE} plan It presumes sanity to prevail in an insane solar PV market {CARDINAL} is on the demand side in terms of policy And also more importantly on the supply side in terms of subsidies and also credit access coming from China What would prevent that into leaking into downstream as you go into fully as you transition fully into nonsubsidized markets by {DATE} So would you not be still muddling around with the same dynamics as you go forward,6,84,0,0.0,0.0,0.011904761904761904,0.0,0.0,0.942013645,12.94,8987.8776,5,0.34042647299999995,0.93872,2013-Aug-02,CHD
And finally just {CARDINAL} quick one for me You mentioned kind of more interesting deal activities Are you suggesting there 's a level that could result in really a dramatic change in what you 're doing on the M A front that would maybe alter your repurchase plans or is it still more of these kind of smaller tuck in things just more of them out there,3,67,0,0.0,0.029850746268656716,0.04477611940298507,0.0,0.0,1.442151086,12.94,4802.1046,11,0.370201211,7.7576399999999985,2013-Aug-02,EXR
Understood The other question I had was so you are now counting the CMBS conduit as a discontinued operation Can you comment on what the amount outstanding on that is as of {DATE} and what your intentions are Or I presume that means you 're going to unwind it or sell it but how should we think about that,4,59,0,0.0,0.0,0.01694915254237288,0.0,0.03389830508474576,1.138563387,11.98,8120.389259999999,1,1.1423742609999998,1.53349,2013-Aug-05,TSN
Fair enough But is there any more on sales of disposals Can you give me an indication of what you may be doing in terms of the portfolio over the rest of {DATE} You have been very active obviously over {DATE} I just wondered if there will be a continuation of that kind of activity or whether you think you are settling into the asset base you 've got,5,69,0,0.0,0.014492753623188406,0.014492753623188406,0.0,0.0,2.762021357,11.84,26207.44193,10,0.074825251,0.69834,2013-Aug-06,REGN
{CARDINAL} last question Given sort of some of the transition in transmission projects in {CARDINAL} should we expect margins in electric power to be a little bit better or a little bit softer than,2,34,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.029411764705882353,0.029411764705882353,1.3966242830000002,11.84,8635.1208,11,1.578834699,1.51135,2013-Aug-06,UNM
Okay Pat do you feel like you can increasingly use this low operating ratio as a way to stimulate demand So use price a little bit Does that matter at all Or is this really just the underlying organic growth rate and when it comes it 's going to come and the pipeline looks good but price is n't really a factor,5,62,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.016129032258064516,0.0,1.3966242830000002,11.84,8635.1208,11,1.578834699,1.51135,2013-Aug-06,UNM
Okay I appreciate that And not to beat a dead horse on the ethanol side but you were very clear at the end of that you are running the ethanol business for profits not for volumes The tone of your comment seems to have changed a little bit Am I reading too much into that or are you just running for volume now and not returns,5,66,0,0.0,0.0,0.015151515151515152,0.0,0.0,1.357806769,11.84,7761.339879999998,3,0.215032495,1.04005,2013-Aug-06,TDG
Okay very good Then just a quick follow up on the share buyback I think you just mentioned that it could relate to some future asset sales To the extent you do that do you envision it being more of a programmatic buyback or would it be more opportunistic and price based and spread out or maybe clumped together in a shorter period of time,4,65,0,0.0,0.03076923076923077,0.03076923076923077,0.015384615384615385,0.015384615384615385,1.357806769,11.84,7761.339879999998,3,0.215032495,1.04005,2013-Aug-06,TDG
Oh okay All right Second question You said that the development of unconventional resources internationally was progressing more quickly than you expected Does that raise the prospect of frac capacities emerging internationally over {DATE} or {CARDINAL},5,36,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.027777777777777776,0.027777777777777776,1.701483006,11.84,22123.49829,6,0.217919193,3.03445,2013-Aug-06,CTSH

Hi I am going to ask a question on a different topic on long acting Factor IX Assuming the data are positive what are the next steps for this program and where are you with manufacturing,2,36,0,0.0,0.0,0.027777777777777776,0.027777777777777776,0.027777777777777776,0.8953769690000001,11.84,9102.31284,9,0.397793063,0.05388,2013-Aug-06,HSIC
Okay I 'm sorry {CARDINAL} point of clarification then I 'll get off You were saying that auto you saw a slight improvement in auto through {DATE},4,27,0,0.0,0.0,0.037037037037037035,0.037037037037037035,0.0,1.823542449,11.84,12415.1664,10,0.38332561,0.0,2013-Aug-06,DVA
And then on the tax rate looks like you 'll get some benefit {DATE} maybe a percent or so from {DATE} Is there anything particular that would drive the reduction in your tax rate,2,34,0,0.0,0.029411764705882353,0.029411764705882353,0.029411764705882353,0.0,1.4893458940000002,11.84,15490.72064,8,1.127989589,1.2792,2013-Aug-06,FE
Thanks Just one more you had mentioned obviously that if you can keep these margins up assuming you can control costs Can you give any color on what keeps you up at {TIME} on not being able to do that,3,40,0,0.0,0.0,0.025,0.025,0.0,1.4893458940000002,11.84,15490.72064,8,1.127989589,1.2792,2013-Aug-06,FE
Good {TIME} Did you get any sense from your customers and I understand it 's still early in terms of the size of phase {CARDINAL} spending relative to phase {CARDINAL} in China,2,32,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03125,0.0,1.4893458940000002,11.84,15490.72064,8,1.127989589,1.2792,2013-Aug-06,FE
Okay And as we look at the sequential changes in the sub reported business units segment I 'm sorry from {DATE} and the first that dental business again endodontics and consumables is what 's dragging that down versus orthodontics and infection because that 's the one that 's down mid teens now versus low double digits in {DATE},3,58,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.042314855,12.72,22035.28428,7,0.936968568,1.45432,2013-Aug-07,CTL
And the comment on the tax rate,1,7,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.042314855,12.72,22035.28428,7,0.936968568,1.45432,2013-Aug-07,CTL
I would like to clarify the sales forecast do you expect {DATE} {DATE} sales to be flat to {DATE} sal the new {DATE} sales which slightly lower than {DATE},1,29,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.92769173,12.72,50192.15768,8,1.153529317,1.16472,2013-Aug-07,DUK
Good {TIME} {DATE} guys The first question I had was on a clarification Of {PERCENT} of the customers you polled was that weighted by revenues or just by number of customers And then what percentage of the key account customers would you say were bullish on {DATE},4,47,0,0.0,0.0,0.02127659574468085,0.02127659574468085,0.02127659574468085,0.92769173,12.72,50192.15768,8,1.153529317,1.16472,2013-Aug-07,DUK

Okay and but pulp and we 're starting to see Asia kind of roll out right now that there 's certainly a lot of capacity coming on over a {DATE} period starting {DATE} Reports indicate that discounts are up and your forecast continues to be even down significantly above where we are year to date I mean is there really anything you 're seeing in terms of securing supply that,3,70,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.267122816,12.72,22653.2376,4,1.229207923,5.94807,2013-Aug-07,DVN
Also you talked about hedging I 'm assuming that because interest expense is projected down {DATE} that a significant amount of that is through interest rate swaps Can you give us some color in terms of the magnitude of interest rate swaps transactions that you 've done And also how far out into the future do those swaps mature just for modeling purposes,4,63,0,0.0,0.0,0.015873015873015872,0.0,0.0,0.943362383,12.72,23124.23646,11,0.34971913600000004,2.84357,2013-Aug-07,MMC

Okay And the {DATE} stay out period I know that obviously has not been approved yet but assuming it is should we also assume as you 're planning through that time period that you 're fairly confident that ROEs will be maintained we wo n't see any erosion Is that a fair way to be thinking about that period when you have a stay out,3,65,0,0.0,0.0,0.03076923076923077,0.015384615384615385,0.015384615384615385,1.386621705,12.98,36827.68,11,1.555430384,7.50713,2013-Aug-08,PRU
Got it Got it On the NIM side if you look through the deeds on the average balance sheet it 's kind of simple that asset yields coming down those deposits primarily foreign deposits And it seems like you have less room on the liability side Is that basically where we 're at now And you mentioned you think you could defend these levels even with the ECB cut but is there any chance to remove the deposits over maybe with the Fed and pick up a little bit,6,89,0,0.0,0.02247191011235955,0.033707865168539325,0.0,0.02247191011235955,1.550846695,12.98,9844.808,4,0.552254893,0.49624,2013-Aug-08,CXO

Okay And also just on P&I given that it was the biggest driver of the guidance coming up could you give us a little bit of a sensitivity as to how to look at I know you said you are close to {PERCENT} contracted {DATE} But is there anything that could change there to swing guidance even further up or maybe down somewhat from that business,4,66,0,0.0,0.06060606060606061,0.06060606060606061,0.0,0.0,0.964256028,14.71,15092.09422,11,0.7392169759999999,0.45958,2013-Oct-17,MTB

{CARDINAL} quick questions guys {CARDINAL} point of clarification so if we were to think about the spot pricing for the tier {CARDINAL} crystalline players and use {MONEY} or {MONEY} discount as your third party sale is that the right way to think about it Or that number is much lower now given you guys have been able to reduce the balance of system costs dramatically,3,65,0,0.0,0.0,0.015384615384615385,0.015384615384615385,0.015384615384615385,0.985834636,14.71,72897.72304,12,0.558867553,1.84108,2013-Oct-17,UNP
Then my follow up is really the historical market Markem Imaje business That business does have quite a bit of exposure to Europe I think the core result 's pretty good What do you think is going on there Maybe a little bit of color And do you expect the business to fade given leading indicators in Europe Or do you think these new product launches are superseding that impact What do you think,8,74,0,0.0,0.013513513513513514,0.02702702702702703,0.02702702702702703,0.0,1.126165868,14.71,15073.75104,3,0.468742804,1.35323,2013-Oct-17,DOV

Okay great Thank you for your perspective on that And rich I 'm relatively new I 've only covered the stock for {DATE} I was n't around for {DATE} I 'm trying to understand why a business most of the food and beverage companies I 've covered if they have {DATE} that it 's something more like a {PERCENT} {PERCENT} affect on sales in {DATE} as opposed to {PERCENT} What is it about the sales cycle or the linearity to the weeks in {DATE} particularly that makes it only a {PERCENT} impact And how did you handle when was {DATE} because I could n't find it looking through and how did you handle it last time,7,116,0,0.0,0.008620689655172414,0.008620689655172414,0.008620689655172414,0.008620689655172414,1.086281629,13.16,5775.32433,12,0.367750619,1.29244,2013-Oct-22,TSS
Okay That 's encouraging Any way to try and size the impact of the inventory headwinds that you had in {DATE} and particularly {DATE},3,24,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041666666666666664,0.0,1.086281629,13.16,5775.32433,12,0.367750619,1.29244,2013-Oct-22,TSS
Got you And then just my follow up on expenses just stepping back again when you guys talked about expenses being flat on a year over year basis given the amount of new business you picked up {DATE} and the timing of the onboarding is it still fair to think that expenses are going to be in that {MONEY} run rate,3,61,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.086281629,13.16,5775.32433,12,0.367750619,1.29244,2013-Oct-22,TSS
Hey good {TIME} Here with Sloan as well Doug and Mike you gave pretty elaborate details on your {DATE} guidance and obviously assume the Lehman space and Heller Ehrman does remain vacant for {DATE} And you also talked about perhaps some interest for the Heller Ehrman thus far Can you give us updates in terms of where the Lehman space might stand in terms of tenant potential interest and then have you even had conversations yet with potentially the private equity firms looking at that sort of project management business,6,90,0,0.0,0.022222222222222223,0.03333333333333333,0.011111111111111112,0.0,1.556549545,13.16,3611.7215200000014,11,0.444213883,1.21721,2013-Oct-22,CNC
Craig you mentioned in your press release or maybe in your prepared remarks the complicated nature of the heavy process market I wondered if you can get a little bit more color into that I think we 're all understanding of the marketplace and the pressures put on maybe is it more client specific what Jacobs provides to the clients is it overall just general malaise and concern Could you maybe expand a little bit about how that is impacting your near term visibility and results,5,86,0,0.0,0.046511627906976744,0.046511627906976744,0.0,0.023255813953488372,1.556549545,13.16,3611.7215200000014,11,0.444213883,1.21721,2013-Oct-22,CNC
And then I 'll ask {CARDINAL} more question and then I 'll jump back in the queue With respect to your cash deployment {DATE} it sounded like that your number one option was to do more M&A and then number {CARDINAL} might have been share buyback Any change in thought with current conditions now,4,54,0,0.0,0.018518518518518517,0.018518518518518517,0.0,0.018518518518518517,1.932369866,13.16,85695.924,10,0.306167558,2.98036,2013-Oct-22,AMGN
Hi good {TIME} guys I just had {CARDINAL} quick questions The first one is on the NMC extension congratulations on that first The question I have for that is when we look into {DATE} I know the ownership comes down is it fair to assume that you guys with the expansion program there that earnings should be able to at least hold flat,4,63,0,0.0,0.0,0.015873015873015872,0.031746031746031744,0.031746031746031744,2.01980642,13.33,10608.39514,6,0.256918069,1.63802,2013-Oct-23,CTXS
Thanks There have been reports over {DATE} that Intel 's been cutting prices on Ivy Bridge I was hoping you could just comment on that is it true what 's behind it,3,32,0,0.0,0.03125,0.03125,0.0,0.03125,2.01980642,13.33,10608.39514,6,0.256918069,1.63802,2013-Oct-23,CTXS
And then just last one for you Neil I calculate your billings were up high teens and I 'm wondering I know most of your business is billed on a {DATE} basis and I 'm wondering if we should be looking at revs plus change in deferred as any sort of metric for your business what are your thoughts there,2,60,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.107100313,13.33,7078.8585,6,0.230430737,7.09305,2013-Oct-23,FFIV
Thanks for that And then I certainly understand your thought process around no structural changes to the core CMG category growth rate Do you think for planning purposes that perhaps the historical {PERCENT} rate as a category in {DATE} may prove overly optimistic or do you think that might still hold for {DATE} as well,3,55,0,0.0,0.05454545454545454,0.05454545454545454,0.01818181818181818,0.0,2.0851664530000003,13.33,5008.47152,11,1.9152697,0.42939,2013-Oct-23,ETFC
Okay That 's helpful And then maybe one for Jay or Sean Obviously you put a lot of capital to work in {DATE} You announced {DATE} 's deal But as soon as you step back the markets got a little more choppy as we have gone over {DATE} or {CARDINAL} Is that either delaying or accelerating the conversations And where are you sort of most focused at this point in terms of new investments,8,74,0,0.0,0.013513513513513514,0.013513513513513514,0.0,0.013513513513513514,1.4375624809999998,13.33,9541.16673,6,0.322524535,4.04631,2013-Oct-23,AKAM
Okay And then in terms of the merchandising initiatives that you have in place for the back {CARDINAL} can I just clarify are they in place now that we should see them in the store or are they going to ramp up throughout the back {CARDINAL} to where the benefits are going to occur as they ramp up,2,58,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8446293029999999,13.33,10366.28221,12,0.237075469,2.69434,2013-Oct-23,SRCL
So mind you this is a good thing but it 's a good thing and uncomfortable at the same time I just want to check the accounting on all the mortgage related positions You had a positive P&L impact in the subprime warehouse and residual positions and I would call your CDO mark reasonably good all things considered and everything that 's happened So the question is are all these assets marked to fair value are any of them held to maturity and was this just great risk management in preparing for a rainy day because you 've been selling off securities in that securities portfolio over {DATE},4,108,0,0.0,0.0,0.009259259259259259,0.046296296296296294,0.009259259259259259,1.3509466069999998,13.33,9567.29298,9,0.167137045,5.29009,2013-Oct-23,TSCO
Got it Can you also talk about this monster sale you are running Is that nationwide and what 's the average price cut you are offering,3,26,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.038461538461538464,1.114834746,13.33,56500.8957,10,0.273741529,1.99519,2013-Oct-23,LLY
Yes so I 'm wondering you mentioned in your prepared remarks that in your internal forecasting that you 've taken into account the impact from the new ICANN rules on online advertising and pacing that you 've kind of assumed a smaller amount of online advertiser names I 'm just curious how small do you think that can get in the mix in terms of the percentage,2,67,0,0.0,0.0,0.014925373134328358,0.0,0.0,1.217019103,13.33,5621.4599,11,1.430713705,2.28788,2013-Oct-23,NDAQ
And what do you think the timing is on that visibility,1,11,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.217302307,13.42,25312.31859,6,0.425460127,5.20906,2013-Oct-24,RTN
Hi Sorry This is Vincent sitting in for Julio I 'm just wondering I 'm sorry we have actually been jumping back and forth between earnings calls but if you have not answered we were just wondering considering that there 's only {CARDINAL} remaining in {DATE} just wondering the range in terms of the EPS guidance that you have provided for {DATE} in terms of the between the top and the bottom and what was baked into assumptions and what sort of assumptions that you have considering in terms of providing the guidance,5,93,0,0.0,0.0,0.021505376344086023,0.0,0.0,2.7160556510000005,13.42,6477.66132,12,0.311875512,1.19855,2013-Oct-24,PHM
Great and for my follow up I guess you guys kind of started out the year believing we were looking at a midteens PC kind of year If I put any kind of close to normal seasonality in your revenue in the back {DATE} you 'd be up well into the {DATE} It certainly does n't seem like you 're outshipping demand because there 's know where in the supply chain building any inventory so is it safe to say your expectations then for {DATE} PC number have just come up a bit,3,93,0,0.0,0.0,0.010752688172043012,0.010752688172043012,0.0,0.960752426,13.42,7280.20224,6,0.063410824,1.50419,2013-Oct-24,VRSN
And what kind of agent count growth would you need to see for that to be achievable,1,17,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.986772113,13.42,6819.27018,11,0.89579586,0.17577,2013-Oct-24,TMK
Dave so you think you could come out with products that will compete effectively with Lincoln and Prudential and Met and can be viewed in the same light,1,28,0,0.0,0.03571428571428571,0.03571428571428571,0.0,0.0,2.7636056589999995,13.42,11015.2288,12,0.260381198,0.39594,2013-Oct-24,UAL
This is Alina Khaykin sitting in for John Just a few quick questions {CARDINAL} on the raw materials I know you said that you expect that the pricing that you put through so far will recover the raw material cost But how much pricing do you think you will have to give up if any when raw material costs do decline say in {DATE},4,64,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03125,0.962571021,13.42,14464.388969999998,8,1.0274936,0.21705,2013-Oct-24,XEL
Okay Then any chance you want to maybe quantify Keith I think you used the word gap in {DATE} related to the stronger {CARDINAL} that I guess the framework assumes you normalize in {CARDINAL} Is that a {MONEY} or {MONEY} type of range Are we way off the reservation with that guesstimate,4,52,0,0.0,0.019230769230769232,0.038461538461538464,0.019230769230769232,0.0,1.157782606,13.42,32704.6632,9,0.29983368,4.67592,2013-Oct-24,MCK
Okay and maybe just quickly on the communication front there was a number of the large the large telco players that recently were out making positive commentary on spending for {DATE} in terms of pushing forward some investments Is that sort of the demand we 're seeing in the context of the Com business being so strong relative to the rest And I guess in terms of historical reference in times when that 's happened has the spend continued regardless of the economic environment,3,84,0,0.0,0.011904761904761904,0.011904761904761904,0.023809523809523808,0.0,1.102055615,13.42,4387.8770399999985,11,1.95873904,1.92073,2013-Oct-24,AIZ
Hugh your corn traits are up {PERCENT} Can you break that down for us between price volume and mix And what kind of pricing do you expect in the upcoming U.S. season,3,32,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03125,2.129875126,13.42,16503.921459999998,10,1.104884925,1.17426,2013-Oct-24,BSX
Okay great Then my last question is with regard to the transitioning old Kindred assets Is there typically any weakness with the transitioning operators from the properties,3,27,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037037037037037035,0.07407407407407407,0.859688118,13.42,15744.3234,1,0.06635426400000001,1.02512,2013-Oct-24,HSY
Okay And then my second question is are you seeing more activity down in the lower credit quality consumer I do n't want to say subprime yet but are you starting to see that come back on,3,37,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02702702702702703,2.520730851,13.42,4075.8236,6,0.494138263,0.5039,2013-Oct-24,FLIR
And do you have a similar sort of pipeline number that you can share with us going forward,1,18,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.995440427,13.42,7434.7092,12,0.331627391,0.8542700000000001,2013-Oct-24,EFX
Okay And then the dynamic lapse assumption that moved from {CARDINAL} to about where,2,14,0,0.0,0.0,0.07142857142857142,0.0,0.07142857142857142,0.995440427,13.42,7434.7092,12,0.331627391,0.8542700000000001,2013-Oct-24,EFX
Is there any possibility of a change in routing protocol to use perhaps other less congested hubs that could help solve the problem,1,23,0,0.0,0.08695652173913043,0.13043478260869565,0.0,0.043478260869565216,1.408577541,13.2,17642.9022,11,0.269726245,2.15917,2013-Oct-25,WY
Okay That 's very helpful {CARDINAL} follow up unrelated Just on the GlucoClear program Based on the commentary {DATE} and the asse write down is assumed there to assume that program is now dead or what 's going on with the program,5,42,0,0.0,0.0,0.047619047619047616,0.0,0.0,1.408577541,13.2,17642.9022,11,0.269726245,2.15917,2013-Oct-25,WY
And I guess is there a way for you to quantify a normal product transition in terms of drag so we can understand the impact on {DATE},1,27,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037037037037037035,1.4876880819999998,13.2,19358.91256,11,0.491215217,0.22037,2013-Oct-25,VTR
Okay And then maybe for Fredrik or for Oscar As we think about the cost structure insofar as volumes disappoint us {DATE} so they 're unexpectedly weak how much of your cost structure is variable How much can you sort of tweak that {MONEY} higher if you had to and how much is more fixed such that as you dedicate these resources locomotives employees to move the current volume we run the risk that we create a higher cost structure in {DATE} let 's say,4,85,0,0.0,0.011764705882352941,0.047058823529411764,0.0,0.03529411764705882,1.4876880819999998,13.2,19358.91256,11,0.491215217,0.22037,2013-Oct-25,VTR
Got it And just in terms of what is driving that Is it is there a relationship between top line and margin Or is that just kind of that mid to high teens margin business no matter how big you are,5,41,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.4876880819999998,13.2,19358.91256,11,0.491215217,0.22037,2013-Oct-25,VTR
Okay that 's helpful And I guess my follow up question and separately the ISO business the net revenue presentation you said it 's {PERCENT} of total revs {DATE} and {PERCENT} of EBIT I would 've actually thought that on a net basis that ISO processing business was really high margin above the Company average but obviously it 's below given it 's less of an operating income percent than revenue So I would 've thought like {PERCENT} margins Maybe you can just talk a little bit about the margin dynamics,5,91,0,0.0,0.01098901098901099,0.01098901098901099,0.0,0.01098901098901099,1.2913090390000002,13.2,19201.721,9,0.106434933,0.6102,2013-Oct-25,SHW
Okay On your reserves net charge offs were down Looks like your stress testing your base case range moved down {MONEY} or so Reserve to loans now {PERCENT} Seems like everything points to a reserve release and yet you built reserves {DATE} How do you think about this as we move through {DATE} Should we start seeing matching charge offs under provisioning How do you think about that,8,68,0,0.0,0.0,0.014705882352941176,0.0,0.014705882352941176,1.469318098,13.2,12675.36102,5,0.289709632,1.20434,2013-Oct-25,EMN
You mentioned the {MONEY} in inflation would remain static in terms of your expectations for {DATE} If oil and steel and all of the other various base metals remain flat from here on out at current levels what is the {CARDINAL} inflationary situation versus {CARDINAL},2,45,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.653285931,13.09,473224.408,6,0.32665749,1.6422,2013-Oct-28,AAPL
Kelly is this effect of realigning or getting your definition of TDRs in line is that now fully baked in or do we see more you mentioned TDRs will probably grow in {DATE} Is that the continued realignment or is that just due to deterioration that you see out there,2,50,0,0.0,0.0,0.02,0.0,0.02,1.272809716,13.31,22964.62284,5,0.34966358700000005,0.22188,2013-Oct-29,APD
Okay And what gets them to pull the trigger When do we start to see more of these conversations actually turn into mandates,3,23,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.272809716,13.31,22964.62284,5,0.34966358700000005,0.22188,2013-Oct-29,APD
So the SG&A it 's not as if you this SG&A is n't a structural headwind that takes you off that previous view,1,23,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.336618717,13.41,8794.94933,11,0.484029888,0.54774,2013-Oct-30,KIM
Great Thank you John any additional color on the large deals I know you said fed but is there a certain vertical you would call out And was complexity part of it just confusion around architectural change,5,37,0,0.0,0.0,0.02702702702702703,0.02702702702702703,0.02702702702702703,1.604559799,13.65,14573.04165,11,0.749227648,2.55022,2013-Oct-31,IVZ
I was wondering Kevin if you could provide a little more color on the competitive trends in the US I know you touched a little bit on it but also how do you expect those trends to change as the economy weakens,2,42,0,0.0,0.023809523809523808,0.023809523809523808,0.0,0.023809523809523808,1.604559799,13.65,14573.04165,11,0.749227648,2.55022,2013-Oct-31,IVZ
Thanks and echo the congrats of others Ron and Kevin could you just help a little bit in giving us an idea of what OpEx will do in a very general sense given kind of the average revenue growth you talked about How should we see that either staying stable or growing with revenue,3,54,0,0.0,0.018518518518518517,0.018518518518518517,0.018518518518518517,0.0,1.604559799,13.65,14573.04165,11,0.749227648,2.55022,2013-Oct-31,IVZ
Charlie on the deferred revenue the sequential improvement was the lowest level I think in {DATE} Can you just maybe talk through what some of the factors that caused somewhat of a lower level of improvement in that line item,2,40,0,0.025,0.05,0.05,0.05,0.0,0.830013936,13.65,11756.9602,5,0.024449399,5.11581,2013-Oct-31,CLX
And I guess I am just trying to understand kind of the additional cost that maybe you had n't seen before Is that just sharing more of the cost with the retailers as you do the rollout or is it just costs of transitioning the plants is maybe greater than you originally expected,2,53,0,0.0,0.03773584905660377,0.03773584905660377,0.018867924528301886,0.0,1.278490244,13.65,19151.80525,11,0.393022383,147.78673,2013-Oct-31,EQR
That 's great So you obviously already sold Lima You 've now announced Aruba You 've just completed the strategic review with the Board Should we take that to mean should we expect there to be continuous high grading as we get into {DATE} and you 're kind of taking it {CARDINAL} refinery at a time or does the conclusion of the review process mean you 've done Lima you 're going to do something with Aruba and that 's it in terms of I guess selling or high grading the existing refinery asset base,8,95,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.010526315789473684,0.0,1.278490244,13.65,19151.80525,11,0.393022383,147.78673,2013-Oct-31,EQR
And lastly Rick I wanted to come back to an acquisition question Is there a way you can look at not just maybe broad line businesses but other ways to grow the broad line business Because I 'm seeing in the past it 's largely just been pure acquisition of these businesses But any tools you can acquire I think {DATE} you actually mentioned that there are other core competencies that SYSCO has that you could use to build upon that could actually also be market share cals Any thoughts on that,6,92,0,0.0,0.03260869565217391,0.03260869565217391,0.0,0.010869565217391304,1.803612337,13.75,9602.56872,1,0.647258793,4.85329,2013-Nov-01,MHK
I 'm looking at in {DATE} it was {MONEY} Now {DATE} it 's {MONEY} in the category commercial loans which is separate from commercial mortgage or commercial construction or commercial leases so if it 's not just {CARDINAL} area can you just give us a little more color as far as the several parts that might be in there,2,59,0,0.0,0.01694915254237288,0.01694915254237288,0.0,0.0,1.803612337,13.75,9602.56872,1,0.647258793,4.85329,2013-Nov-01,MHK
On Genome Analyzer I know you were not willing to answer the question in terms of sequential growth or lack thereof in terms of placements But maybe taking this from a different direction in terms of the longer term outlook you 've talked about freeing up capacity for genotyping production If demand for GAs was to increase by say {CARDINAL} over the balance of {DATE} are there any capacity concerns that you have that would hinder you from meeting that demand,3,81,0,0.0,0.012345679012345678,0.012345679012345678,0.0,0.04938271604938271,1.258362271,13.75,4082.47786,11,0.21491069,16.95531,2013-Nov-01,AIV
Last question on {DATE} payable outstanding Looks like they have almost doubled {DATE} Can you walk through why this has increased and if that is sustainable going forward,3,28,0,0.0,0.03571428571428571,0.03571428571428571,0.0,0.03571428571428571,0.710757182,13.75,231765.599,4,0.7324671629999999,0.98139,2013-Nov-01,CVX
Looking at the Homer City utilization {DATE} and comparing to {DATE} it looks like this {DATE} 's run rate is more consistent with what we saw in {CARDINAL} Should we think about this reflecting more of a normal weather environment from a baseline utilization for those assets and that maybe {DATE} is a little bit more of an aberrational event,2,60,0,0.0,0.016666666666666666,0.016666666666666666,0.0,0.016666666666666666,1.7480848000000002,12.93,4208.97972,4,1.024916764,2.78818,2013-Nov-05,NFX

Yes that 's great And just on a production question given your new outlook for {DATE} can you give some indication of what that would mean specifically for your Barnett volumes,2,31,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03225806451612903,0.03225806451612903,2.476873864,12.93,27434.76397,10,0.074825251,2.97478,2013-Nov-05,REGN

Got it {CARDINAL} more follow up on that then In terms of all of this announcement so the LOI with the National Grid and even {MONEY} incremental with Northeast Utilities and the Allegheny project and none of them are actually in the backlog right now So all of them are probably going into the backlog at the end of Second question on that When do you guys realistically think CREZ might actually move into the backlog during {CARDINAL},6,78,0,0.0,0.01282051282051282,0.02564102564102564,0.0,0.01282051282051282,1.417058194,12.93,26271.86445,6,0.217919193,3.63007,2013-Nov-05,CTSH

I just had {CARDINAL} follow up question and know it is obviously very early here relative to the exchanges which do n't go up for {DATE} But just interested in your initial thoughts on the structure of those and whether you think the exchanges could be a viable business and how should we think about that business relative to is it more going to look like what we think about as sort of certain government businesses like Medicaid or do you think this could be more like a commercial margin type business,2,92,0,0.0,0.021739130434782608,0.021739130434782608,0.0,0.010869565217391304,0.898485118,12.93,6826.59072,5,0.229921211,1.67829,2013-Nov-05,IFF
Okay Got it And then when you think about the trend through {DATE} and into {DATE} being positive can you separate out how much of that is market versus potentially some pull forward of demand from the price increase announcements,3,40,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.025,0.0,0.807873666,12.93,9709.22886,9,0.397793063,0.47345,2013-Nov-05,HSIC
Operating expenses were flat sequentially We had been expecting some impact from {CARDINAL} time items such as severance Did those items occur and the run rate expense fall to offset them during {DATE} How should we think of operating expenses versus,4,41,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.807873666,12.93,9709.22886,9,0.397793063,0.47345,2013-Nov-05,HSIC
I will add to Sherry 's comments as our thoughts and prayers are with the Thai people and your employees I know it 's a dynamic situation but in terms of the equipment itself what happens when water touches it Is it even recoverable Are all of those suppliers still in existence or what has to happen from an equipment standpoint if they are not,4,65,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.097770524,12.93,15942.39392,8,1.127989589,0.45542,2013-Nov-05,FE

So I think one of the frustrations by people in your business has been clients basically used the recession as a way to simplify their marketing spend in many cases it was because they had to spend less money so if they previously divided the US up into {CARDINAL} geographic areas to target they went to {CARDINAL} to save money That may not have been the right business decision but they had to do it Are you starting to see clients come back to you saying we oversimplified our marketing spend or our marketing method and while we are not ready to go back to the way we used to market because we are not comfortable with our spending we acknowledge that we were drowning in our cuts and we plan to spend more and basically go back to somewhat the way it was Looking for color if you had some acknowledge by clients that in some industries they really over cut spending during the panic,4,166,0,0.0,0.012048192771084338,0.012048192771084338,0.0,0.024096385542168676,2.387840091,13.55,21928.3896,6,0.645051673,2.28694,2014-Jan-07,MU

Okay And then just {CARDINAL} follow up for Ted When I do the incremental segment margins or incremental margins just in general for {DATE} they would appear to be pretty high Seemingly even at the midpoint maybe above normal And is that again is that driven by volume,5,48,0,0.0,0.020833333333333332,0.041666666666666664,0.0,0.0,1.156394817,12.28,8226.5337,11,0.712455229,1.4066299999999998,2014-Jan-16,HBAN

Final question You 're gearing up in asset based lending I know and I guess the question is as the runoffs continue and in the riskier segments what we should expect in a reasonable time period in terms of when we see the re emergence of aggregate loan growth as {DATE} plays out,3,53,0,0.0,0.0,0.018867924528301886,0.0,0.05660377358490566,0.905025385,12.44,10487.88504,3,0.176703768,0.72629,2014-Jan-21,COL
No I appreciate that Just as a follow up on growth if you look at large services companies Facebook Amazon Google they are all growing over {PERCENT} and it is largely driven by activity of Apple users on iOS devices Do you feel like there 's more that Apple can do to participate in that services growth or are you relegated to fundamentals that are tied to a device upgrade cycles,3,71,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.905025385,12.44,10487.88504,3,0.176703768,0.72629,2014-Jan-21,COL

So they would n't fall under the MERP If you increased capital base in those assets you 'd have to file a separate proceeding to get the recovery,2,28,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.830263159,12.44,26581.81422,12,0.497795148,0.37493,2014-Jan-21,DAL
Okay And then in terms of the {DATE} impact from the higher compaction cost is there {DATE} that stands out in the next let 's say {CARDINAL} that would be hit the most,3,33,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.302503601,12.87,8672.16654,10,0.216867467,0.14194,2014-Jan-22,VAR

Okay great and then a question on the CCC Is that a margin impact in addition to a volume impact Is there anything that changes there as you go to an electronic ordering format Either lower overhead on your side of the business from an order input standpoint or is there any impact beyond what we 've seen to be obvious volume improvement,4,63,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.031746031746031744,0.015873015873015872,2.566122429,15.8,72234.87344,10,0.13398749,0.36161,2014-Jan-29,BIIB
And then just following up on the structured finance comments can you talk a little bit more about the book If you look in {DATE} it looks like your yields came down a little bit and your volume was a little lower Can you talk about maybe how you see that trending and maybe timing on new starts or new initiations,3,61,0,0.0,0.03278688524590164,0.03278688524590164,0.0,0.0,1.028280287,15.8,12213.2246,3,0.286309871,1.21522,2014-Jan-29,AME

And then the second question Jeff in Europe {PERCENT} margin target {DATE} out is I think more than you have made in the past I 'm just curious as you look at both the market and the new business or platform you 'll be operating there what 's different on either side of that that would allow this to make margins that you have n't achieved in the past,4,69,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.014492753623188406,0.014492753623188406,1.431870099,17.35,5753.16147,12,0.161159425,0.81285,2014-Jan-30,RHI

Thanks George if I could just press you a little bit more on the R&D budget We get that {DATE} is {DATE} but I think in {DATE} we were also talking about R&D as a percent of sales coming down to the maybe {PERCENT} range in {DATE} Is that still l an appropriate target And then also for Paul on the tax rate maybe you could explain why things have gotten so much better there in {DATE} and whether that 's sustainable,5,82,0,0.0,0.04878048780487805,0.04878048780487805,0.012195121951219513,0.0,0.984072155,17.35,415489.3665,4,0.4890176020000001,0.07701000000000001,2014-Jan-30,XOM
Good {TIME} Could you talk a little bit about NGL prices It obviously has come down in {DATE} I think it 's firming up a little bit now But what are the thoughts on putting some hedges in there on the midstream side just to give yourself some protection when those are weak at times,5,55,0,0.0,0.01818181818181818,0.01818181818181818,0.01818181818181818,0.01818181818181818,1.559023104,17.35,11117.24685,2,0.407675965,1.14445,2014-Jan-30,WHR

Jim just following up on the landfill volumes As you look out {DATE} or so on a {DATE} basis do you start hitting easier comps on the C&D side do you anniversary some of the moves I think you made on special waste or just what are some of the moving parts there basically does that become less of a drag,2,61,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01639344262295082,0.01639344262295082,1.019032266,17.35,8489.7652,11,0.7173880090000001,2.15525,2014-Jan-30,SLG
Good {TIME} On the International side I mean you 've talked a lot about your intentions to grow that share of your portfolio I 'm wondering mostly that 's been through development so far are you looking harder at any acquisition opportunities given the difference between the health of the U.S. economy right now and some of the other markets,4,60,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03333333333333333,0.0,1.113222325,17.35,19164.09696,9,0.094381191,1.6349200000000002,2014-Jan-30,SHW
Well how I mean there is obviously been discussion in the market about actually having portfolios out there and things you know sort of falling out of bed Can you just talk about what the disconnect or what the spread is versus the offers you 're receiving and where you think pricing is,2,53,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.983936734,17.35,60737.7015,10,0.324067628,0.03,2014-Jan-30,LLY
Terrific {CARDINAL} last question I said {CARDINAL} I lied {CARDINAL} more On the wind energy side it is not just the transmission benefit you 're seeing you 're also getting into the wind farm business While it is not that big of a portion of your revenue right now but would it be fair to characterize you guys as {CARDINAL} of the top {CARDINAL} contractors serving that market so you 're in a driving seat to really benefit as that market continues to grow,8,84,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.023809523809523808,0.011904761904761904,1.346609859,17.35,22691.14665,9,0.3891680420000001,1.04644,2014-Jan-30,CAH

Thanks for taking the question Just a general question on Avonex Jim you alluded to a loss of US market share Can you maybe talk about what the drivers of that might be Is that increased competitive activity or maybe some change of effort on your part And can you without giving anything away can you talk a little bit about what specifically you are going to do to change that dynamic,6,72,0,0.0,0.041666666666666664,0.041666666666666664,0.0,0.041666666666666664,1.134446763,17.35,15278.422880000002,3,0.361320697,0.02236,2014-Jan-30,DOV
Okay I guess back to the claim activity I guess I understand comments around incidence being a slight uptick which you are characterizing as kind of random fluctuation but the other side of that is recoveries looked better offsets looked better Would you characterize that as normal volatility as well or is there anything different you are doing in whether it 's reserving or what have you that 's part of that answer,4,73,0,0.0,0.0,0.0410958904109589,0.0273972602739726,0.0273972602739726,1.134446763,17.35,15278.422880000002,3,0.361320697,0.02236,2014-Jan-30,DOV

A couple of quick questions maybe a follow on to Michael 's question about US Gas Power With the PGC extension does that increase your appetite for maybe some incremental development outside of what you 've talked about explicitly Or maybe some additional M&A in that area,3,47,0,0.0,0.06382978723404255,0.06382978723404255,0.0,0.0425531914893617,1.081269848,17.29,20354.535,2,0.367903329,0.52022,2014-Jan-31,PCAR
First question just relative to the near term environment and this is n't specific to Applied because we 've had the same questions as an industry for the competitors as well it seems like what we were hearing at SEMICON West does n't quite match what 's happening in the very near term Was that just a function of us misinterpreting the comments at SEMICON West to be nearer term or have there been some pushes since those meetings relative to what we 're looking at in terms of {DATE},3,90,0,0.0,0.0,0.011111111111111112,0.0,0.03333333333333333,0.916528837,17.29,47496.94005,11,0.122921721,1.6630599999999998,2014-Jan-31,SPG
Thank you A couple of questions On necitumumab how confident are you that the drug is approvable in lung now that you have positive results in hand that you top lined {DATE} and what 's the development program from here It seems that with positive lung results you 'd be pushing into broader development but I have n't heard you yet articulate what 's next Are you going to hold off doing anything until you see whether the drug gets approved in lung Second question on your {CARDINAL} insulins novel basal and insulin glargine wondering if you can characterize what you think the bigger commercial opportunity would be with either those drugs when you look out over {DATE},6,118,0,0.0,0.0,0.00847457627118644,0.03389830508474576,0.01694915254237288,1.307860044,17.29,9435.49828,1,0.6866550440000001,2.02516,2014-Jan-31,TSN

Got it And then I guess just on the OII process with OII {CARDINAL} kind of each {CARDINAL} and {CARDINAL} seeming to kind of trudge along are there still expectations that {CARDINAL} can have some visibility in {DATE} or does it look like it 's going to drift {DATE} before there 's kind of visibilities to where the commission is headed,2,61,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.942865842,17.29,8693.544,3,0.241410694,0.92266,2014-Jan-31,NWL

Okay and then following up on your earlier comments on services revenue is it safe to assume the {CARDINAL} is a good run rate for {DATE} Is there any seasonality of that business And then thinking about it going forward should it really be growing in line with membership at this point or are there other callous that could cause it to accelerate from these levels,3,66,0,0.0,0.015151515151515152,0.030303030303030304,0.015151515151515152,0.0,1.132382357,17.29,4803.74752,3,0.309124979,0.4292,2014-Jan-31,AVY

My question is around average selling prices If you look at the average selling prices in {DATE} they improved sequentially and obviously you 're seeing both mix helped out on the consumer side But as we get a little bit deeper into the corporate upgrade cycle you 're going to see a lot higher dollar value How should we be thinking about average selling prices Should we see steady sequential improvement there Or some of the puts and takes around where you 're seeing growth in the PC market going to offset that,6,93,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.021505376344086023,0.010752688172043012,1.347517021,21.44,12278.1727,11,0.684115592,1.0622200000000002,2014-Feb-04,PFG

Thanks I suppose there will be {CARDINAL} questions on corn so I was wondering if we he could talk about the longer term vegetable outlook for a second As we start to think about the period beyond say {DATE} I 'm curious how sensitive your expectation for vegetable seed growth is to the rate of farm commercialization or any other big bottlenecks that are out there Obviously the growth looks like it 's there on the demand side I 'm just curious what 's going to determine the rate of growth and how quickly we get there,5,97,0,0.0,0.010309278350515464,0.010309278350515464,0.0,0.020618556701030927,1.679187399,21.44,3270.02431,11,0.378417709,0.49048,2014-Feb-04,CNC
Good {TIME} gentlemen First question on the fuel proceeding within Wisconsin Based on current commodity prices relative to what you have filed in {DATE} what are your expectations if you have any on the under recovery for the remainder of {DATE},3,41,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.024390243902439025,0.024390243902439025,1.679187399,21.44,3270.02431,11,0.378417709,0.49048,2014-Feb-04,CNC
Right But in terms of I guess what you are looking at is some downward pressure in Polymers and maybe Catalysts is sort of the same and maybe Fine Chemicals is sort of the same I know that you have a bullish outlook toward {DATE} but it just seems like so much refinery expansion has been pushed off And as you have said customers are using catalysts longer So basically are you looking I mean if your run rate of earnings now is {MONEY} a share is the right number for {DATE} something like {MONEY} as well in this sense,7,100,0,0.0,0.02,0.03,0.0,0.01,0.921147261,21.44,11144.3262,5,0.024449399,1.0842200000000002,2014-Feb-04,CLX

Yes Thank you for taking my call You have given us a lot of useful information with respect to modeling and I can understand that you would be hesitant to talk about cost of goods sold but we are both you and us dealing with fairly unprecedented change in terms of rapidity with which things are moving Can you give us some indications of how we might model things like utilization and in that our cost of goods sold model,4,80,0,0.0,0.0125,0.0125,0.0,0.0,1.402249755,19.11,8174.3706,11,0.965137312,1.35665,2014-Feb-05,UNM

Rene that said is there any way you can give us an update of where you expect TCE to be post Provident versus {DATE} so that we do n't double count meaning so we do n't double count,1,38,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.627135617,19.11,8302.23069,6,0.312644132,2.99293,2014-Feb-05,AKAM
I actually just had a quick follow up question on the seasonality aspect I know that seasonality tends to play a part through {DATE} in consumer credit trends so I guess I was wondering if you can comment a little bit further on really what component of the delinquency improvement that you commented on earlier as being a key driver of your expectations here for {DATE} as being driven by this,2,71,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.014084507042253521,0.028169014084507043,1.330665098,19.11,20142.77514,11,0.370625472,1.42415,2014-Feb-05,AMP

All right the other question I had was just in terms of bringing on I guess the early stage delinquent commercial loans on to NPL sooner I understand that working with the borrowers from an earlier point in time before they become completely delinquent makes helps reduce severity in the long term But does it matter if you bring them on NPA now or if you 're just working with them while they 're still performing I guess why the distinction of bringing on increasing your NPAs because with {DATE} delinquent,4,91,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01098901098901099,0.054945054945054944,0.8556856070000001,19.11,19959.56118,11,0.559267057,6.87471,2014-Feb-05,EQR
Thanks Hi Jim When you mentioned earlier that sequential growth rates will decelerate and not accelerate were you referring to overall or was that relative to specific end markets,3,29,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.021701767,19.95,14255.2864,9,0.15012492300000002,3.41162,2014-Feb-06,ORLY

Okay And then I remember your Tunisian drilling program could be meaningful in terms of production contribution because the wells come on pretty strong Are we still but that was from {DATE} that I recall What about now Is it still the same type of wells,5,46,0,0.0,0.021739130434782608,0.021739130434782608,0.021739130434782608,0.021739130434782608,1.021701767,19.95,14255.2864,9,0.15012492300000002,3.41162,2014-Feb-06,ORLY

Thanks for taking my question First question is according to your metrics what percent of patients really struggle with tolerability on Atripla according to your databases And may second question is for Norbert Have you given any thought to I know your HCV pipeline is early Have you given any thought or see a need to participation your drug with some of the earlier drugs that are going to come to market in the hep C space,6,77,0,0.0,0.012987012987012988,0.012987012987012988,0.0,0.03896103896103896,0.856326832,19.95,9511.5748,8,0.735121702,1.51963,2014-Feb-06,WEC
{CARDINAL} question just back on pricing It seems like when cotton pricing came to a head the industry as a whole is starting to push it through but there seemed to be less of that when there was fuel type of increases to the overall cost base Why do you think that is,3,53,0,0.0,0.0,0.018867924528301886,0.0,0.018867924528301886,1.091988673,19.95,24730.24944,8,1.51768397,0.65277,2014-Feb-06,EXC
So where does your R&D to sales have to go to accomplish those objectives,1,14,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07142857142857142,0.0,1.7290577,17.23,7893.968000000002,10,0.318157072,0.93907,2014-Feb-07,LH
Okay and then following up on the question of SG&A that continues to be a really good story You 're comping what had been double digit SG&A growth for {DATE} I guess with {DATE} and now it would appear to be more difficult comps just in terms of the growth rate of spend has slowed a lot Can you continue to generate this type of revenue growth with a much more modest SG&A investment or should we think that because you 've now lapped that in the comps would appear to be a little more difficult that {DATE} growth in that spend might accelerate a little bit,3,107,0,0.0,0.009345794392523364,0.028037383177570093,0.009345794392523364,0.037383177570093455,1.413257591,17.23,16513.227,12,0.023592209,2.78253,2014-Feb-07,MCO
Very good And as a follow up to that question you obviously talked about your bookings by end market If you look at sales growth in {DATE} what areas would you expect to be relatively stronger,3,36,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05555555555555555,0.027777777777777776,1.413257591,17.23,16513.227,12,0.023592209,2.78253,2014-Feb-07,MCO
Let 's see a couple of items The strength in your length of haul in the coal business in and of {DATE} drove some nice yields and revenue per unit How much of a headwind do you think that creates {DATE} in and And then if we couple that with the decline in the export met pricing and just the decline in export met volume do you think it 's possible that revenue per unit could go negative in coal in or,4,82,0,0.0,0.024390243902439025,0.024390243902439025,0.012195121951219513,0.036585365853658534,1.413257591,17.23,16513.227,12,0.023592209,2.78253,2014-Feb-07,MCO
You mentioned that you continue to be pleased with the ROI on the sales territories that you 've been adding here in {DATE} and I think you also mentioned that you 're on track to be at the higher end of your {DATE} plans But I wanted to ask have you given any thought {DATE} hiring plans and do see enough opportunity out there to keep your foot on the accelerator in terms of hiring,2,75,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02666666666666667,0.0,1.1043688,17.23,4195.085,11,0.237668884,7.2831100000000015,2014-Feb-07,AIV
Okay And last quick one in I think your chemistry growth was {PERCENT} We do n't know what the number was for but it 's probably {PERCENT} Is the right way to think about this from here is just really think about the first half growth and project it forward or it does sound like you might think it may be a little bit better than that,4,67,0,0.0,0.029850746268656716,0.04477611940298507,0.014925373134328358,0.0,0.917125343,15.26,18960.249,8,1.20496877,0.12223,2014-Feb-11,PCG
Okay Very helpful The second question and this is a high class problem but you have been spending a little bit {PERCENT} on R&D towards {DATE} or for {DATE} Would that potentially come in as your sales grow going forward Or should we expect you to be spending more closer to the {PERCENT} range as opposed to your {PERCENT} long term target in the near term,5,66,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045454545454545456,0.917125343,15.26,18960.249,8,1.20496877,0.12223,2014-Feb-11,PCG
This is actually Tom Nikic on for Ike Thanks for taking my question I was wondering as a follow up to the earlier question about SG&A how it should progress over the course of {DATE} I would assume that as hopefully sales results improve {DATE} moves on that some of the variable expenses would move up Is it safe to assume that it would n't just be low double digits across the balance of {DATE} but it would step up as {DATE} progresses,5,83,0,0.0,0.0,0.03614457831325301,0.03614457831325301,0.024096385542168676,0.917125343,15.26,18960.249,8,1.20496877,0.12223,2014-Feb-11,PCG
Would it be possible to share the rough percentages of property the revenue from property in {CARDINAL} versus what you would see on a {DATE} basis just so we get a better sense of that seasonality,1,36,0,0.0,0.027777777777777776,0.027777777777777776,0.027777777777777776,0.0,1.264227884,15.26,19088.46537,12,0.230455495,1.0385799999999998,2014-Feb-11,OMC
Got it Then for Michael on the CEO search it sounds like you 're getting closer there I 'm wondering if you could provide an update As you 've gone through candidates what sort of background or what sort of characteristics in a CEO you 're looking for as the process has gotten to this point,4,56,0,0.0,0.017857142857142856,0.017857142857142856,0.0,0.0,1.264227884,15.26,19088.46537,12,0.230455495,1.0385799999999998,2014-Feb-11,OMC
Just wanted to touch back onto the {MONEY} Mark So as you think about {PERCENT} {PERCENT} do you think that 's a how should we think about that transition I know you 're saying it should n't be a big part but do you think that moves to {PERCENT} by the end of or how do you think that trends longer term,4,62,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.264227884,15.26,19088.46537,12,0.230455495,1.0385799999999998,2014-Feb-11,OMC
Okay So based on that we should still generally think about buybacks and dividends being roughly equal to {DATE} operating earnings,2,21,0,0.0,0.0,0.047619047619047616,0.0,0.0,2.5992980880000003,15.26,29764.032000000007,10,0.071145371,0.82214,2014-Feb-11,REGN

Pete just going back to the last question can we get just a little more detail on the decision making process not only on the store closures but on what the right number of openings are on the licensed and the Company side What do you expect for total CapEx now in {DATE} and if you can share it for {DATE},2,61,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03278688524590164,0.869363043,15.26,26379.55974,1,0.216564733,1.7910400000000002,2014-Feb-11,RAI^G17

Bret or Chris I guess if I could start with you guys just on the new product Chris you 've provided a lot of detail on a lot of the products that have been launched but costs has been a little elevated here ahead of some new product launches for {DATE} Can you give us any I know you do n't like to talk about new products before they launch but obviously I 'd assume the office based MTM product that I 'm hearing now may be early in {DATE} is one of those but anything else you can give us regarding new products in {DATE},3,106,0,0.0,0.018867924528301886,0.02830188679245283,0.0,0.0,1.184262566,15.26,17738.91546,11,0.646105563,0.92987,2014-Feb-11,HCP
That makes sense And then on the tax line can you talk about taxes over the next say {DATE} Between the bonus depreciation and Qwest 's NOLs how do you think that affects both the GAAP and the cash tax lines,4,41,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.032401577,14.51,17572.54083,7,1.180493337,22.59862,2014-Feb-12,CTL
{CARDINAL} questions {CARDINAL} on the account growth Can you give us a sense of the composition how much of that was BTs And are you seeing the same type of response rate as you were precrisis or has there been an improvement beyond what you are experiencing before,3,48,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.020833333333333332,0.020833333333333332,1.032401577,14.51,17572.54083,7,1.180493337,22.59862,2014-Feb-12,CTL
Okay Then my final question looking at the organic growth within the Brokerage segment It looks like it was just on the core commissions and fees of {PERCENT} And then we saw {PERCENT} in {DATE} so obviously the {PERCENT} is still a very positive number my question is just that sequential decline Is there anything to read to in that or did just happen to be a particularly super {CARDINAL} or,6,71,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.014084507042253521,0.04225352112676056,1.43804631,14.3,12615.70464,2,0.285779662,4.37686,2014-Feb-13,BWA

And then secondly just in terms of the iPhone ramp you mentioned that this was really a demand issue Can you confirm that there have been no production or component issues to date And if there have n't been I guess the question is why would n't you have pushed the launch date out {CARDINAL} or {DATE} so you would n't have created what appears to be widespread stockouts frustration among customers that they ca n't get it et cetera Was it just beyond the {CARDINAL} standard deviation expectation for demand initially or so A can you confirm that there has n't been a production or component shortage issue to date And then B if that has n't been the case why would n't a business practice suggested that waiting to ramp capacity and launching in a way that could have been more satisfying to more customers have been prudent,7,150,0,0.0,0.013333333333333334,0.02666666666666667,0.006666666666666667,0.02666666666666667,1.468236658,14.3,14358.71332,8,0.420079689,2.30972,2014-Feb-13,EQT

It sounds like deduplication certainly could be a potential headwind here in the short run but as you start to anniversary the installation of the technology you should go back to a normalized kind of share gain environment is that the right way to look at it,1,47,0,0.0,0.02127659574468085,0.02127659574468085,0.02127659574468085,0.0,1.188502241,14.14,18409.4706,11,0.5385062860000001,1.3693,2014-Feb-14,VTR

Hi thanks guys Appreciate your comments about the guidance and the growth rates improving throughout {DATE} in {DATE} Do you expect though on a {DATE} basis that payroll growth will remain in negative territory for {DATE} or is there a possibility it could return positive by the latter part of {DATE},3,51,0,0.0,0.0196078431372549,0.0392156862745098,0.0392156862745098,0.0196078431372549,0.7108489379999999,13.57,50443.19985,8,1.105661494,2.3477900000000003,2014-Feb-18,DUK
You indicated that one should not really draw conclusions based on the low numbers of PML cases When do you think that we can actually draw some conclusions including the optimal duration of therapy,2,34,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7108489379999999,13.57,50443.19985,8,1.105661494,2.3477900000000003,2014-Feb-18,DUK
Okay and that kind of gets to my second question I think when we were in Detroit {TIME} you mentioned that by {DATE} you could be back at an {PERCENT} operating margin Is that consistent with what you 've told us here in terms of {DATE} guidance for earnings Will you be quite that strong by {DATE},4,57,0,0.0,0.017543859649122806,0.017543859649122806,0.017543859649122806,0.017543859649122806,0.7108489379999999,13.57,50443.19985,8,1.105661494,2.3477900000000003,2014-Feb-18,DUK
As you look out over {DATE} at the equity needs between your drip programs and potential asset sales do you envision coming to market with the secondary And then just as a follow up on that besides Barnett where do you see the monetization opportunities,2,45,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.022222222222222223,0.0,1.225656991,13.57,13266.98415,9,0.26831528600000004,0.8734299999999999,2014-Feb-18,GPC
Thanks good {TIME} Wondering could you give us some color on what you were seeing from commercial customers over {DATE} Was there any increase in loan demand and what kind of benefit was there after you closed on Financial Federal in terms of customer relationships and new business,3,48,0,0.0,0.020833333333333332,0.020833333333333332,0.041666666666666664,0.020833333333333332,2.440683685,13.87,9758.12892,4,0.5995821139999999,0.97786,2014-Feb-19,XEC
Okay Let me try to figure out which question Maybe a question for Neil I think one of the things that caught my eye was the slowdown in the programming expense growth both {DATE} and on a per sub basis I guess looking forward again maybe what is driving that And do you think we are through the worst of the increases we are going to see,6,67,0,0.0,0.029850746268656716,0.029850746268656716,0.0,0.05970149253731343,2.440683685,13.87,9758.12892,4,0.5995821139999999,0.97786,2014-Feb-19,XEC
Steve can you just talk about {QUANTITY} things {CARDINAL} is occupancy in the Vegas property seemed a little bit low and I was just wondering if that 's a part of your policy to try and hold a premium price or hold rate Or did I miss something on number of rooms out or something like that,3,57,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.017543859649122806,2.440683685,13.87,9758.12892,4,0.5995821139999999,0.97786,2014-Feb-19,XEC
First I was hoping you could comment on the retail activity in {DATE} and the near term hiccup we 've had with the US macro data and all the turmoil in the EM Are you guys seeing any difference in terms of the reengagement levels which it sounded like it was picking up throughout the course of {DATE} and started off pretty well early in {DATE} But just wanted to be sure if that has continued so far,3,78,0,0.0,0.01282051282051282,0.01282051282051282,0.0,0.01282051282051282,1.346741294,13.87,10638.69532,3,0.183178649,0.07127,2014-Feb-19,FLS
Sure Then given the fact that the is now yielding like {PERCENT} or so should we assume like if we end {DATE} in at {PERCENT} that the same type of {CARDINAL} basis points down draw is FAS the same in {DATE} as it was in {DATE} Or is it because you 're more asset sensitive there is a little bit higher impact,3,62,0,0.0,0.0,0.016129032258064516,0.0,0.0,1.346741294,13.87,10638.69532,3,0.183178649,0.07127,2014-Feb-19,FLS
And sometimes we have had {DATE} and then kind of catches up a little bit in {CARDINAL} You did n't sense any kind of boost from just kind of {DATE} flush,2,31,0,0.0,0.03225806451612903,0.03225806451612903,0.03225806451612903,0.0,1.346741294,13.87,10638.69532,3,0.183178649,0.07127,2014-Feb-19,FLS
Okay and then just lastly sorry if I missed it but in terms of provisions versus charge offs going forward would you expect continued build to the extent we saw {DATE},2,31,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03225806451612903,1.269885009,13.87,25541.46,4,1.006878398,0.26864,2014-Feb-19,DVN
Thanks for squeezing me in guys and let me add my congratulations both on {DATE} and Avila Can you just talk about I hate to start thinking about limits to growth but the margins have been so spectacular both above the line and on the operating line that where can they ultimately go to I would think that there is maybe a number in your guy 's mind that where you get to you 're not going to be able to squeeze much more juice out of that lemon Just wondering what you 're thinking about margins in that respect,5,100,0,0.0,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.0,1.219657522,15.5,6816.7559999999985,12,0.655611567,4.7257099999999985,2014-Feb-20,PWR
Just a follow up on capital I just wanted to from a big picture perspective you 've got the NPR changes {CARDINAL} basis points also from the deal {DATE} so as you look forward does this at all change the way you 're looking at the buyback Will you continue to pour through the buyback as planned in this {DATE} 's allowable and then will it change it all the way you think about capital return into {DATE} and acquisitions as well,3,82,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8237815490000001,15.5,6816.6265,8,0.967035558,0.98295,2014-Feb-20,SCG

Hi thanks a lot Just a follow up on Travelocity You mentioned that it contributed {PERCENT} to room {TIME} Given that it 's {DATE} how fully ramped is that I know you are just rolling out in Canada now Should we expect that contribution to be similar {DATE},6,48,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.381483773,15.5,11946.84239,1,0.288957354,0.24295,2014-Feb-20,HRL
Okay Then my last question is just on CapEx You lowered the expectations there {DATE} Now they are lower again so it is a pretty significant difference from where you were in {DATE} What 's the biggest drivers there,6,39,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02564102564102564,1.937990718,15.5,12064.26946,4,0.448677123,0.5261899999999999,2014-Feb-20,CXO
Good {TIME} I want to ask {CARDINAL} areas {CARDINAL} is your strategy in deli meats Are you changing any pricing or trying to get into any different segments in that area And then second can you just update me on peanut contracts for the Skippy business Where are those,6,49,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02040816326530612,0.0,2.4724820380000003,14.79,12060.22314,12,0.940189081,5.1186,2014-Feb-21,NEM
Great And then just a final question could you just comment a little bit about current linearity You mentioned bookings down slightly sequentially But can you talk a little bit {DATE},4,31,0,0.0,0.03225806451612903,0.03225806451612903,0.03225806451612903,0.03225806451612903,1.55065589,14.79,10598.8925,1,0.453377507,1.57262,2014-Feb-21,MHK
Good {TIME} Barry and Reed and congratulations on {DATE} A couple of questions here First I just want to begin just to Reed to understand where you might be spending the money You mentioned that if one is a purist it would look like you are lowering your {PERCENT} growth but either way you look at it you have achieved with or without performance or otherwise you have achieved a base now and you are going from this higher base so I 'm trying to see if you 're being conservative in the guidance for {DATE} if there are some spending plans or if you are trying to maybe grow the EPS a little slower and I have a quick follow up,4,122,0,0.0,0.01639344262295082,0.01639344262295082,0.02459016393442623,0.01639344262295082,1.808950431,14.68,4631.5069079999985,8,1.3927038980000002,0.90074,2014-Feb-24,FTR

Great thanks That 's helpful And second on the Eagle Ford really thinking strategically about what the Eagle Ford can mean for the company do you see if the play does work in some size that would be completely additive as a new source of investment Or along the similar questions asked earlier about whether Eagle Ford will be prioritized would you then look to replace Eagle Ford on the portfolio and say sell an asset elsewhere such as maybe the Raton,4,82,0,0.0,0.012195121951219513,0.012195121951219513,0.012195121951219513,0.012195121951219513,1.5295938619999998,14.23,6953.57918,11,0.458106028,4.56628,2014-Feb-25,DLR

Can I ask a follow up on that if I may The feedback we get from investors is there 's still some angst about the future of EPOGEN in the context of other competitive products that may be entering Is there anything you 've done recently that you feel solidifies your position with EPOGEN and dialysis And how reliable is that {PERCENT} erosion base,4,64,0,0.0,0.03125,0.03125,0.0,0.015625,0.89185523,14.23,16779.2665,8,1.145770203,2.46341,2014-Feb-25,EIX

Again if they do file charges where is the implication in terms of just all the other I guess financial implications Is it an insurance issue or is there some other parts of this process where it could impact,2,39,0,0.0,0.02564102564102564,0.02564102564102564,0.0,0.0,1.188929288,14.23,13257.891,8,1.423978895,1.72217,2014-Feb-25,FE
Okay great And then just a quick one for Ted on Logix I think it was {PERCENT} growth {DATE} Is the outlook still embed a high single digit growth rate for Logix in {DATE} And then the other piece of it is with the incrementals being so strong {DATE} it seems like the bias for {DATE} is that the incrementals are going to be closer to {PERCENT} rather than {PERCENT} is that a fair statement,5,75,0,0.0,0.0,0.013333333333333334,0.02666666666666667,0.0,1.188929288,14.23,13257.891,8,1.423978895,1.72217,2014-Feb-25,FE

And my last question I know that you do n't have any equity plans over the {DATE} CapEx cycle and so when you talk about the earnings CAGR I believe it is {PERCENT} over the {DATE} period from the normalized {DATE} base and the rate base CAGR over that {DATE} period is {PERCENT} Am I correct in those numbers,2,59,0,0.0,0.0,0.01694915254237288,0.0,0.01694915254237288,1.556860877,13.67,14201.3718,4,0.23137958600000005,0.75271,2014-Feb-26,RRC
Just a quick question on your ownership position in Enable Currently it does n't look like the general partnership gets any value at all in the current stock price of CenterPoint I was wondering how will you think about that general partnership over time I mean I know the idea is to sort of grow those distributions over time But if it gives Enable sort of a shot in the arm and reduces their cost of equity and makes them more competitive in the market would you think about rolling the general partnership and IDR structure into the limited partner,5,100,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02,0.01,1.556860877,13.67,14201.3718,4,0.23137958600000005,0.75271,2014-Feb-26,RRC

{CARDINAL} of the other things you mentioned at CAGNY very important for {DATE} is trying to get a sense of elasticity and the potential changes in elasticity curves Can you give us what you 're learning in Personal Care Consumer Tissue KCP about that,2,44,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.036688665,13.67,10877.7072,12,0.067802813,0.18007,2014-Feb-26,VRSK

Thank you good {TIME} I want to ask about growth and sort of a couple parts to the question It looks like Asia Pacific organic was {CARDINAL} but that obviously and assumes the drag from optical and D&G. And I guess {CARDINAL} for the year I mean how does that dovetail George with what I think is somewhere around {PERCENT} organic growth target for {DATE} Does that still seem to be based on everything that 's going on does that still seem to be the good number to shoot for,6,90,0,0.0,0.0,0.022222222222222223,0.022222222222222223,0.022222222222222223,1.121620987,13.67,10368.8016,8,0.892076,1.87106,2014-Feb-26,CNP
Yes hi good {TIME} A question on the pipeline Would you say that {CARDINAL} of your pipeline is related to energy and then can you give us a breakdown as to how much of it is related to metals particularly steel,3,41,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.024390243902439025,0.04878048780487805,1.121620987,13.67,10368.8016,8,0.892076,1.87106,2014-Feb-26,CNP

I guess as you mentioned at current exchange rates the implied benefit on your top line at least at this stage for {DATE} is {PERCENT} Does that imply that organic sales are expected to be somewhat lower than initial guidance suggested if I 'm reading that right or are you just kind of taking a conservative view on that,2,59,0,0.0,0.01694915254237288,0.03389830508474576,0.01694915254237288,0.0,0.8362159509999999,14.35,22558.12,8,0.631368273,3.47739,2014-Feb-27,SRE

Okay and then also going forward I was curious on sort of how you think you 're going to grow your relationships with some of your JV partners I think it 's no secret that CPP is out there and wants to grow their portfolio pretty materially And cap rates are pretty low for A quality assets Do you see yourself maybe doing some sort of materially sized JV of some of your wholly owned assets as a method of delevering considering where the market is {DATE},4,87,0,0.0,0.011494252873563218,0.011494252873563218,0.0,0.0,1.5909402069999998,13.89,8531.05198,11,0.16707187099999998,6.11126,2014-Mar-06,HRB

Yes thank you Just a couple questions on expenses You mentioned that those are likely to be elevated for {DATE} into the future I guess specifically on the FTEs that were added for the servicing portfolio is it your expectation that those will remain relatively static to the number of FTEs you onboarded or did those come down over time therefore reducing the potential expense related to that revenue,4,69,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.014492753623188406,1.62072347,13.27,16903.94328,12,0.778210176,0.81577,2014-Apr-24,LUV

So just as a follow up on that can you size {DATE} Cigna was able to size the actual how much what they have at risk in their guarantee trend guarantees and performance guarantees in {DATE} Can you size that for us on your fee book also,2,47,0,0.0,0.0,0.02127659574468085,0.02127659574468085,0.0,1.846476585,13.32,11983.21146,2,0.407675965,0.6373800000000001,2014-Apr-25,WHR
Good {TIME} everyone Not too much to pick on for sure solid {CARDINAL} overall I just wanted to focus a little bit on the working capital and inventory issue and I think the heart and my question is relates more to HOS That 's when you put up an {PERCENT} core number which is probably the highest you guys have had in {DATE} does it put a lot of projects on hold and make it really difficult to manage working capital and push HOS forward Or is this more of a strategic decision just to build inventory ahead of price increases and obvious demand that 's going to pull through {DATE},6,111,0,0.009009009009009009,0.0,0.009009009009009009,0.018018018018018018,0.018018018018018018,1.551767731,13.32,7133.9965200000015,10,0.436757845,2.83831,2014-Apr-25,UHS
Okay And then {CARDINAL} quick one on the government side If I am doing the math correctly and the adjusted Surveillance margin is {PERCENT} a little under Can you talk about the sustainability of that type of margin there,4,39,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.070911973,13.32,18925.27542,11,0.5385062860000001,0.2357,2014-Apr-25,VTR
That 's great thank you My last one my follow up for Pete Just want to make sure I 'm thinking about the various buckets correctly If I look at in {DATE} the incremental Dionex and Phadia accretion the FX and then the tax benefit it looks like your guidance assumes somewhere {PERCENT} core EPS growth Does that sound correct to you,5,62,0,0.0,0.0,0.03225806451612903,0.03225806451612903,0.0,1.070911973,13.32,18925.27542,11,0.5385062860000001,0.2357,2014-Apr-25,VTR
okay Fair enough And then the comment on spending free cash flow on dividends and buybacks does that assume that {DATE} earnings will be used on that And then I mean how should we think about the growing excess capital on balance sheet I mean the {MONEY} was certainly larger than I expected it to be at {DATE} particularly given the high buybacks in {DATE} How should we think about that And what when would you look at that and say maybe we start pairing that down above and beyond investments for growth as you characterized in your comments as well as in the press release,6,106,0,0.0,0.009433962264150943,0.018867924528301886,0.0,0.0,1.007786282,13.32,16800.19692,12,0.3437080770000001,1.01922,2014-Apr-25,WY
Okay But over {DATE} because it looks like with McKechnie you are going to get there a lot quicker than {DATE},2,21,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.007786282,13.32,16800.19692,12,0.3437080770000001,1.01922,2014-Apr-25,WY
Got it And then maybe a question for Jay I know you still have ample capacity on the revolver and continue to generate a lot of free cash but now that you 're going to put some capital to work related to the {CARDINAL} recent transactions if more deals were to materialize over the course of the rest of {DATE} how would you be thinking about funding any incremental transactions,3,70,0,0.0,0.014285714285714285,0.014285714285714285,0.0,0.014285714285714285,1.65702531,13.32,17044.06455,12,0.023592209,1.84648,2014-Apr-25,MCO
Because a lot of people talk about burn out some of the bigger shops thought that most of their HARP loans had burned out but you think you still have got plenty of HARP stuff in your portfolio,1,38,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02631578947368421,1.65702531,13.32,17044.06455,12,0.023592209,1.84648,2014-Apr-25,MCO
Where you have the most pricing power now either by vertical or by geography,1,14,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.023453843,13.32,8128.529490000001,11,0.7899197659999999,1.3547,2014-Apr-25,CINF
And in terms of the dynamics of hotels dropping on the GDS side and being added more on the ETP side are these the same properties or can you speak to that a little bit,1,35,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8486895409999999,13.32,13657.01585,8,0.960209779,1.65388,2014-Apr-25,DTE
What is the next key data point we should think about Maureen What do you think would be the next in terms of timing we might see more clarity as to what might actually be selected,2,36,0,0.0,0.05555555555555555,0.05555555555555555,0.0,0.0,1.216814061,13.32,13196.81919,5,0.348943906,0.55697,2014-Apr-25,EMN
Okay but it sounds like it 's unlikely to be that material to {DATE} in the context of the guidance,1,20,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.218754905,14.06,8486.497,10,0.318157072,0.8611,2014-Apr-28,LH
Good {TIME} I 've got a follow up question just on the capital loss I think if you just take what you 're carrying on the balance sheet {DATE} as the value for the private brands businesses and you add back all the write downs You get to a capital loss I think of {MONEY} or so which would imply a tax asset I guess that would be north of {MONEY} So is that directionally the right way to think about it And I guess if that tax asset ends up being that large can it be used all at once or would it have to be used can you only apply a certain amount of it per transaction or per event,6,122,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.00819672131147541,0.02459016393442623,1.097087799,13.97,17282.397930000006,6,0.174061257,3.3247800000000005,2014-Apr-29,ROK
Right right And then looking at the percent hedged for the currency at {PERCENT} and you 're assuming {MONEY} for the exchange rate do you have any more flexibility to maybe lower {DATE} hedges to benefit {DATE} if the exchange rate does n't go your way,3,46,0,0.0,0.021739130434782608,0.043478260869565216,0.021739130434782608,0.0,0.989566873,13.97,6494.56605,11,0.4722580870000001,1.8385,2014-Apr-29,UDR
Yes hi The {CARDINAL} question I had also was just on the CLL timeline {DATE} you mentioned that you had stopped the trial trying to figure out the right dose Could you help us gain clarity as to in what time frame can you start seeing data for these expanded indications which could be immortalized in being registrational,3,58,0,0.0,0.034482758620689655,0.034482758620689655,0.017241379310344827,0.034482758620689655,0.989566873,13.97,6494.56605,11,0.4722580870000001,1.8385,2014-Apr-29,UDR
Okay just as a follow up on the closing of the Family Dollar transaction I guess it was the third or fourth instance now where the closing has been delayed Is it solely finding buyers for the divested stores that made the FTC approval is that the only hangup Or are there some other topics with the acquisition that 's creating the delays,3,63,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07936507936507936,2.171982913,13.97,30880.96682,4,0.965482259,1.26026,2014-Apr-29,VLO
And just {CARDINAL} last one does this at all change your longer term view of high teens growth over {DATE},1,20,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.171982913,13.97,30880.96682,4,0.965482259,1.26026,2014-Apr-29,VLO
You said that consumer demand was something I think you did use the term erratic You said business demand was still good and that there was some I wish I had it on my screen but I put it away But you did say as airlines try to push fares up to cover fuel costs I think it 's inevitable that you are going to see some push back from consumers So I wondered if you,5,76,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.013157894736842105,0.02631578947368421,1.126592794,13.97,8204.4288,12,0.568676484,2.05006,2014-Apr-29,JEC
Thank you for taking my question First Bob I just wanted to touch on Timberland obviously suffers a loss in {DATE} And I 'm wondering if you can help us think through the magnitude of what that can mean for VF as a corporation Would it be safe to assume that kind of the organic or the core EBIT grows {PERCENT} and then you layer on the loss you typically see for Timberland and as such maybe earnings could be {MONEY} Or is that too negative of an assumption,5,89,0,0.0,0.02247191011235955,0.0449438202247191,0.0,0.056179775280898875,1.102297268,13.97,49269.5515,9,0.320860902,0.9003200000000001,2014-Apr-29,LYB
Okay that 's helpful {CARDINAL} quick follow ups Do you have any idea about the timing of when you might hear on the Express situation And since you did confirm Safeway is there any color you can provide us on the dynamics around that contract change,4,46,0,0.0,0.021739130434782608,0.021739130434782608,0.0,0.0,1.102297268,13.97,49269.5515,9,0.320860902,0.9003200000000001,2014-Apr-29,LYB
Great And then just {CARDINAL} other question on this slide For commercial solar and your wind assets in general just how do you think about the opportunity to construct a YieldCo like some of your peers,3,36,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05555555555555555,0.027777777777777776,1.399585831,13.97,23342.807,2,0.367903329,0.27904,2014-Apr-29,PCAR
Got you And last question The comments made about the Closed Block the {MONEY} of assets that are currently in corporate other would be utilized or deployed over the near term Is that to reduce debt commercial paper Can you just clarify what that 's going to be used for,5,50,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04,1.399585831,13.97,23342.807,2,0.367903329,0.27904,2014-Apr-29,PCAR
And you are seeing the growth internationally I 'm assuming it 's one with some of those accounts as well Is there a feeling that you 're still going to be a main supplier for them in terms of transport outside the US,3,43,0,0.0,0.0,0.023255813953488372,0.0,0.0,1.968900838,13.97,5395.52551,12,0.393196731,0.09562,2014-Apr-29,MLM
Good {TIME} Bob actually a tactical near term question and a second strategic question for you if you do n't mind The Antideficiency Act precludes the government from spending more than Congress authorizes and many contracts are incrementally funded which means warrants should start affecting {CARDINAL} and {CARDINAL} results To what extent does the {DATE} guidance reflect this and can you help us understand your key assumptions Will you pay employees out of profits and assume retroactive authorization or does your guidance presume stoppage of many of your large contracts And can you touch on which large contracts are much at risk under warrant,6,104,0,0.0,0.0,0.038461538461538464,0.009615384615384616,0.038461538461538464,1.470511095,13.97,9219.45024,6,0.209996935,9.65357,2014-Apr-29,WAT
Hi thanks I was going to ask pretty much the same question about CDOs My only concern is if I read the table right it is CDO squared so anything you can elaborate on that you know regarding the underlying attachment points that type of thing,3,46,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043478260869565216,1.868470919,13.97,6543.7216,3,0.380852622,1.65852,2014-Apr-29,XYL
So if you saw more raw material increase that is unexpected more than what you were expecting between now and let 's say even {DATE} you would go out with a {DATE} price or {DATE} price increase {CARDINAL},1,38,0,0.0,0.0,0.02631578947368421,0.0,0.02631578947368421,1.273742636,13.97,15385.40874,11,1.151150773,6.6093199999999985,2014-Apr-29,HIG
Then on the some of the new orders for renewable energy catalysts for {DATE} are any of those at risk Are they firm orders or can they be canceled,2,29,0,0.0,0.0,0.034482758620689655,0.0,0.034482758620689655,0.905081609,13.97,20165.55478,11,0.4307701370000001,6.5,2014-Apr-29,GGP
Mark you indicated that you 're seeing growing interest in the integrated offering I was just wondering if you could give us a sense of matter of degree around that And then also what the early read is on trend relative to book under the integrated offering,3,47,0,0.0,0.02127659574468085,0.02127659574468085,0.0,0.0,0.927134435,13.97,18571.227,8,1.145770203,1.4118700000000002,2014-Apr-29,EIX

Okay Second question I had was actually for Ray When you guys issued your press release in conjunction with the A B Inbev assets I think you 'd indicated {DATE} operation that EBITDA would be in the neighborhood of {MONEY} Could you help us with what the breakout is between what the D&A component of that is between EBIT and EBITDA or approximately,4,63,0,0.0,0.015873015873015872,0.031746031746031744,0.0,0.015873015873015872,1.073548194,13.97,5897.84679,11,0.361292424,1.33588,2014-Apr-29,EXR
Okay And just a follow up on one of our earlier comments Is there an official running total of the total GAAP OTTI that has not been pushed over to stat,3,31,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.073548194,13.97,5897.84679,11,0.361292424,1.33588,2014-Apr-29,EXR
Thank you very much And given the fact that your capital levels have improved and credit 's getting better and you have talked about in the past about doing FDIC assisted transactions Have you started to get more involved in that have you studied that more or you just have n't seen anything that 's come out to interest you at this point,3,63,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.031746031746031744,0.0,0.854876181,13.71,17982.79518,11,0.360871882,0.15075999999999998,2014-Apr-30,BXP
Right Are there any particular areas where it is more acute Can you maybe just talk about that in refrigeration And obviously Hill Phoenix is having a great start to {DATE} so maybe the volume just overwhelms that but is there any particular areas where you 're seeing more,4,49,0,0.0,0.04081632653061224,0.04081632653061224,0.02040816326530612,0.0,1.435367344,13.71,49213.51,4,0.616753958,1.35661,2014-Apr-30,PSX
Good {TIME} David Thanks for taking my question guys David you mentioned Kikeh and the recompletion work I 'm sorry if I missed this but I 'm just trying to get a feel do you have a sense of when we may get production back to kind of normalized levels if you will,4,53,0,0.0,0.018867924528301886,0.018867924528301886,0.018867924528301886,0.03773584905660377,1.435367344,13.71,49213.51,4,0.616753958,1.35661,2014-Apr-30,PSX

Thanks Good {TIME} If we look back over {DATE} I do n't think you 've ever had a period where {DATE} operating margins were equal to each other And I know the driver Frank was the base and benefits line but can you dig a little bit more in terms of specificity on that line item And if there were no shifts of costs should we expect and {CARDINAL} margins to be close to equal going forward,5,77,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.012987012987012988,0.0,0.922801518,13.71,42654.47251,8,0.703026202,3.30715,2014-Apr-30,NEE
And then just a follow up on the auto securitization environment is the gain on sale percentage that you generated {DATE} I realize the environment can change but as you look at the market right now is that a good base for us to think about in terms of what the gains could be going forward or has anything changed in terms of the environment,2,65,0,0.0,0.015384615384615385,0.015384615384615385,0.046153846153846156,0.0,1.924787924,13.71,4395.85952,4,1.221406663,0.7188100000000001,2014-Apr-30,NFX
Okay So {DATE} really the focus should be on your internal execution which should allow you to meet the earnings growth goals And maybe the sales growth goals take a back seat as you walk away from some products and maybe still have some issues and ingredients near term,3,49,0,0.0,0.04081632653061224,0.04081632653061224,0.0,0.0,1.34796323,13.71,5794.4304,10,0.619420262,7.28792,2014-Apr-30,HOLX
Okay And there was an earlier question asking about contra revenue I 'm going to ask it this way Given the number of net adds that you had in {DATE} given the base of needs that you had through the quarter I think there are some of us that felt that the revenue would 've been a little bit higher So wondering is it Contra Revenue business outside of the Naming business or something else that may have dampened top line by {MONEY} or {MONEY} or {MONEY},5,87,0,0.0,0.011494252873563218,0.011494252873563218,0.0,0.022988505747126436,1.464266806,13.71,20556.78405,6,0.536379408,1.57061,2014-Apr-30,WDC
How about then looking say ahead to {DATE} or even a little longer term I mean structurally what kind of sales growth do you see on either side of the system at this point,2,34,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8147235420000001,13.71,10868.47944,8,0.735121702,1.63893,2014-Apr-30,WEC
{CARDINAL} questions {CARDINAL} Nick I wondered if you might talk about the environment as we think about the setup here for your fiscal {CARDINAL} It does n't look like we 've had a year like this during an up cycle where we 've seen aftermarket slows since {CARDINAL} {CARDINAL} And you guys saw at that time a pretty good snap back in organic growth in the commercial aftermarket following that period Are we setting up for something like this or do you think we 're going to be at this weak level {DATE} especially given the traffic numbers coming in a little bit better than people have forecast {DATE} I wondered if you might help us think about what you 're thinking {DATE},7,123,0,0.0,0.016260162601626018,0.016260162601626018,0.016260162601626018,0.016260162601626018,0.7606244259999999,13.41,15963.10934,8,1.076394128,0.70736,2014-May-01,XEL
{DATE} by you guys First in terms of the outlook for {DATE} can you just give a little color in terms of percentages what you 're expecting in terms of the different customer groups,2,34,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.233764798,13.41,28904.11923,8,0.318600814,0.59982,2014-May-01,WMB
Okay And then just {CARDINAL} other question on the pension discontinuity So just to restate what I think I heard you say there was a {MONEY} negative impact in the but then the will have a slightly favorable {DATE} impact but {DATE} will be negative by {MONEY} Did I get all of that right,5,54,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.018518518518518517,0.07407407407407407,2.613516732,13.41,15990.3338,10,0.07808659700000001,1.93388,2014-May-01,VRTX
Okay but it sounds like just given the size of North American dental versus international then maybe that pull forward is maybe {CARDINAL} of the bigger if not the biggest factor on the equipment it sounds like,1,37,0,0.0,0.05405405405405406,0.05405405405405406,0.0,0.0,1.357615561,13.41,32194.50304,7,0.155520221,1.22612,2014-May-01,VIAB

Okay And then on the excess investment income side with yields pulling back a little bit kind {DATE} are you still comfortable with the initial guidance you gave for {DATE} I think it was {PERCENT} growth,3,36,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.61340841,13.41,11381.56205,4,0.845571284,0.20964,2014-May-01,MUR
Yes understood And David can you just talk a little bit about how you are thinking about new business kind of your selling effort in an improving economic environment whether what is the state of your sales force Are you growing the sales force Are you changing how they are incentivized or anything like that to try to win new business,4,61,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03278688524590164,0.03278688524590164,0.900446977,13.41,16154.7243,6,0.212995707,0.29014,2014-May-01,MSI

On the DRI Dan I know your friends at Steel Dynamics are saying that they might be able to save something like {MONEY} a ton against the cost of pig iron once they bring their Mesabi Nugget plant on and the way I view your DRI facility seems like an easier technology more experience that you have with it and certainly larger scale But do you think that per ton comparison are you looking at those same kind of things where you could say {MONEY} a ton DRI versus {MONEY} or something like that,3,94,0,0.0,0.02127659574468085,0.031914893617021274,0.02127659574468085,0.010638297872340425,1.455050032,13.41,7529.704559999999,12,0.655611567,0.21792,2014-May-01,PWR

And {CARDINAL} last quick {CARDINAL} on the sale side just in terms of what you 're seeing in Europe obviously you have a pretty high recurring revenue stream and I know the majority of the mix is to countries that are still doing okay But can you talk a little bit in terms of what you 're seeing there in terms of just trends and any significant deceleration,4,68,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.763264,13.41,21034.57274,8,0.882404477,1.15175,2014-May-01,PPL
Thank you And to touch on something maybe it 's become a tradition on the car rental To what extent in the US is the opaque business gone I mean companies keep talking about not offering up any opaque And to what extent can you offset that with non opaque reservations And to what extent are you seeing car availability now,6,61,0,0.0,0.01639344262295082,0.01639344262295082,0.0,0.0,0.763264,13.41,21034.57274,8,0.882404477,1.15175,2014-May-01,PPL

And if I could my follow up is along that line As you look into {DATE} in the guidance for {DATE} is the expectation that you see a recovery in those regions that were weak or have you taken a more conservative view of close rates et cetera as you built out the {DATE} guidance for Europe,2,57,0,0.0,0.017543859649122806,0.017543859649122806,0.0,0.017543859649122806,1.155175941,13.41,21073.86742,8,1.20496877,1.31132,2014-May-01,PCG
A follow up on that FX where it is included when you were discussing the segments and Bob Wells was going over those he talked about that none of those segments had any benefit from FX So that is why I assumed that the big positive swing in the FX would have all been in the admin line So if it is not in the admin line was is it the Global segment that benefited by this {MONEY} favorable swing in FX,4,82,0,0.0,0.0,0.012195121951219513,0.04878048780487805,0.0,0.943836444,13.41,20737.58005,8,1.154698767,0.56142,2014-May-01,PEG

And then the other issue is you guys have some pretty decent loan growth relative to your peer group But there was the fed I think was {DATE} reported that credit is easing which is a good thing for the economy but I 'm just wondering are you easing some of your underwriting standards or are you seeing better credits coming in the door,2,64,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03125,0.03125,0.914697507,13.41,21466.63712,11,0.559267057,0.75056,2014-May-01,EQR

Okay That 's helpful And I guess the follow up in terms of the headcount reductions that were talked about for {DATE} and then I think there was also some commentary about ongoing focus to lower cost regions how should we think about that with regards to {CARDINAL} expenses and potential margins,4,52,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.610794,13.41,15194.065669999998,11,0.55288858,2.67769,2014-May-01,IVZ

Good {TIME} So I guess a question on M&A. Should we expect I mean maybe excluding the Marsh McLennan Agency strategy and the M&A going forward there should we expect acquisitions going forward to reflect non US acquisitions as opposed to looking at some M&A in the US,4,48,0,0.0,0.020833333333333332,0.020833333333333332,0.020833333333333332,0.041666666666666664,1.063200433,13.41,16232.073,11,0.492594992,0.99872,2014-May-01,HST

With regards to the tax free repatriation I 'm curious is this has there been some movement on the regulatory front or is this more a function of sharpening your pencil and getting creative with legal structures And when you talk about the possibility of repatriating {MONEY} in a tax efficient manner I 'm curious does that mean {PERCENT} Or does that mean below some threshold of X percent,3,69,0,0.0,0.0,0.014492753623188406,0.028985507246376812,0.0,0.981919455,13.25,237843.6552,4,0.712945314,1.55691,2014-May-02,CVX
Just trying to peel back the onion here a little bit in the Dental business Steve you called out some of the specifics around the equipment shift the Easter shift {CARDINAL} {DATE} I 'm just curious if you take out all those individual pieces could you maybe give us your assessment of where you think the dental market is trending Both in terms of volumes as well as I 'm sure there was some price inflation that maybe ultimately aided that group Stan if I heard you correctly I think you were seemingly suggesting that the dentist office traffic is somewhat stable I 'm really just trying to get a little bit of a better sense of the organic trends pulling out all of the pieces if possible,6,128,0,0.0,0.0390625,0.046875,0.015625,0.0,0.837949576,13.25,6520.87686,8,0.942248537,3.15879,2014-May-02,LNT

My question is on Tenke and it looks like the current expansion is progressing on target and on budget My question is when should we expect some additional commentary on the next phase Are you sort of working towards completing phase {CARDINAL} first before you look at phase {CARDINAL} and beyond or,4,52,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.019230769230769232,0.038461538461538464,1.042889919,13.8,25036.42295,4,0.8874943609999999,3.3623,2014-May-07,MRO

Okay And then I guess looking more closely at the segments CTS clearly had {DATE} But as I 'm looking at the numbers it would seem that you 're not considering {DATE} a run rate for {DATE} as I think about the targets that you set for that segment {DATE} {DATE} So is there something unique that happened in {DATE} that is n't going to continue or am I looking at it incorrectly,4,73,0,0.0136986301369863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0136986301369863,2.664018321,13.4,28344.9408,10,0.071145371,0.22596,2014-May-08,REGN

Hi guys thanks for taking my call I understand you do n't want to give guidance but just to give me some perspective on visibility how much of your business now is turns business and how much would you normally have visibility on {DATE} And then the follow up question is when you talk about wafer fab equipment spending being {MONEY} it sounds like one customer could be {PERCENT} or more of that wafer fab equipment spending maybe a second customer brings you {PERCENT} of that are you seeing any issues from that concentration of spending at your top {CARDINAL} customers,3,101,0,0.0,0.019801980198019802,0.019801980198019802,0.0,0.009900990099009901,1.482962738,12.96,35844.03675,9,0.492730498,0.19841,2014-May-21,TGT

Great Thank you I was wondering given the shifting of the international landscape that we 've seen in {DATE} does that change at all your level of interest or your perspective on potentially entering those markets at some point And if so do you feel like looking at that that your technology and scale that you 've built here in the US gives you enough of an advantage over those incumbent players,4,72,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.027777777777777776,0.0,1.186086274,11.91,10340.75,9,0.111338001,0.41408,2014-May-22,DLTR

I just wanted to clarify something that Terry said on the Bakken Express if I could I apologize Terry did you say that you thought that you guys would be in a position that even with the binding open {DATE} in the fall that you 'd be in a position to have all of that pipeline capacity committed meaning the {CARDINAL} Or is it getting to that minimum level to make it economically viable,3,74,0,0.0,0.013513513513513514,0.013513513513513514,0.0,0.0,1.601414907,12.03,7024.053059999998,9,0.447850356,1.44221,2014-May-23,FL

Okay and then separately on CapEx are you tracking in line with the breakout that you gave at the analyst day Year to date I see you 've spent {MONEY} But looks like it 's distributed a little bit differently so just wondered if your CapEx plans are the same or different,4,52,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.549011032,10.99,8426.688409999999,11,0.199722468,0.08019,2014-Jun-11,HRB
Okay thank you {CARDINAL} final area separately obviously you are not going to comment in detail about any potential sale or divestiture of the Midwest unregulated plants Could you give us any idea though on if you did no longer own those what would the EPS impact to be In other words suppose they you were not to own them does that hurt earnings help earnings,4,66,0,0.0,0.015151515151515152,0.015151515151515152,0.0,0.030303030303030304,1.6406443780000002,12.06,9927.30592,6,0.141067854,3.37041,2014-Jun-18,RHT

Just curious back on the gross margin which you talked about but did still come in a lot stronger than expected does that make you think about managing gross margin a little tighter {DATE} to try to reinvigorate the same store sales trends Or do you feel like there 's any change in the elasticity of your ability to drive comps with lower prices,4,64,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.015625,0.0,0.895247004,11.15,15297.36087,12,0.123702249,0.45997,2014-Jul-02,PAYX
Yes good {TIME} everyone Just a quick follow up on the cutout margins Jeff for kind of the upcoming quarters I think all of us pretty much anticipate you are going to have a tighter hog supply Is there enough room at retail for the cut out margin for the prices to at least be able to offset your higher costs In other words can you at least maintain your cutout margin for let 's say {DATE},5,77,0,0.0,0.0,0.012987012987012988,0.025974025974025976,0.012987012987012988,0.632236331,11.82,7361.388959999998,1,0.335456343,0.8636799999999999,2014-Jul-15,CTAS

And if I could just follow up to {CARDINAL} thing that you said with regards to the new systems implementation that come in the fall Will that be an immediate impact to margins Will we see that as soon as the new systems are implemented,3,45,0,0.0,0.022222222222222223,0.022222222222222223,0.0,0.0,0.780475648,11.96,61834.82863,10,0.432045946,3.03507,2014-Jul-16,ABT
When you look at the book publishing business which has clearly been an out performer for some time here and you look at a book like Divergent which is a multiple part There are several books in the series How long of a tail does that typically have I know you mentioned more challenging comps in the back {CARDINAL} of your {DATE} But for {DATE} can we continue to benefit from the series or have we already played it through a bit,5,82,0,0.012195121951219513,0.0,0.0,0.012195121951219513,0.012195121951219513,0.8685445479999999,11.96,31285.90745,12,0.659606012,0.91034,2014-Jul-16,CSX

Got it Jim As a follow up to that given you 're seeing more delays more lumpy large projects clearly the buy back will help signal to people your confidence but obviously backlog growth will as well How do feel given the scenarios you 're seeing on the macro side right now and the possibility of some of these projects hitting by {DATE} so people feel more comfortable {DATE},3,69,0,0.014492753623188406,0.0,0.014492753623188406,0.0,0.014492753623188406,0.735660093,11.0,36506.5398,9,0.068785914,0.16772,2014-Jul-17,YUM

Thanks Dan {CARDINAL} more quick questions here {CARDINAL} just on the CRM landscape you 've seen multiple industry competitors talk about kind of a softening in this marketplace Based on your {CARDINAL} guidance it does n't really seem that you 're expecting much of a softening If you are seeing weakness specifically in ICDs where do you think that weakness is Do you view it as economic sensitivity of difficulty in penetrating the primary prevention market,6,76,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06578947368421052,1.127601705,14.54,12495.4095,12,0.323019104,1.31741,2014-Jul-18,KSU
And then finally just {CARDINAL} more for me Just back to this question of channel inventories So at this point you believe distributer inventories are still on the high side but it 's your inventories at the Rockwell parent level that are most are the largest issue Is that a correct statement And then secondly does title to all that inventory pass to the distributors when you ship it or do they have some recourse back to you or consignment type arrangements or anything where really the inventory is still on your dime until they ship out their end,5,99,0,0.0,0.0,0.010101010101010102,0.0,0.010101010101010102,0.754568019,14.54,8939.616,10,0.318157072,0.19,2014-Jul-18,LH
Great My second question sort of goes to sort of the book end comments at the beginning and the end around economic outlook as it pertains to earnings outlook Would it be fair to summarize those comments as saying that should {CARDINAL} {DATE} commodity prices not recover to what we all believe they should that there are offsetting factors that would mitigate that impact on your ability to meet your long term earnings growth goal but not fully offset it Is that fair,4,83,0,0.0,0.0,0.012048192771084338,0.012048192771084338,0.012048192771084338,0.751316731,14.54,74529.5304,2,0.255125244,3.0440400000000003,2014-Jul-18,HON

Is it possible that maybe the decline in retail fuel prices not the I guess what you sell and then to customers is helping the number of visits people are coming around and I guess at the same time with the competitive environment I guess you described it as not getting materially changing that much maybe is there more of a cherry picking mentality that you think that your customer has now versus before,1,74,0,0.0,0.04054054054054054,0.04054054054054054,0.0,0.013513513513513514,0.8315326270000001,12.81,10898.18457,3,0.176703768,0.91257,2014-Jul-22,COL

Okay Thanks And I guess my second question on capital is if I go back to the investor slides that you put out I think it was in {DATE} you talked about the required capital increasing by {MONEY} in {DATE} Given kind of where we sit {DATE} you know annuities are slowing down at least relative to {DATE} And then you have these institutional investment products and I guess I 'm not quite sure what the capital requirements on those are and how they compared to annuities and then you have this longevity risk transfer business that you are adding Kind of when you think about the business mix shifts that are occurring in terms of new business any changes to the kind of that {MONEY} number in terms of incremental capital that you needed {DATE} as you think {DATE},7,140,0,0.0,0.0,0.007142857142857143,0.0,0.014285714285714285,1.090288769,12.24,62972.2334,5,0.441311403,0.34658,2014-Jul-23,DOW^I17

I wanted to explore the capacity performance penalty side of the equation Leila you touched briefly on it Just curious if the ultimate rule ends up quite similar to the proposed penalty rule that PJM has laid out would that as you asses the risk reward of your fleet do you think that would likely lead you to think about some degree of asset shutdowns None at all Or how do you generally think about that the risk of penalties,5,80,0,0.0,0.0,0.025,0.0125,0.05,2.392937474,12.56,10663.20585,7,0.224160493,1.29628,2014-Jul-29,LVLT

Thinking back to NAREIT there was a decent amount of talk about PSA jumping their street rates by {PERCENT} overnight I 'm just curious whether you 've seen any incremental improvement in pricing power since that happened or if things just have remained pretty consistently strong,2,46,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043478260869565216,0.0,0.8249995720000001,13.33,6149.563679999998,11,0.361292424,0.12170999999999997,2014-Jul-31,EXR
Okay I guess I was trying to get a little bit more about what the opportunity was like what regions you think you would be able to sell into what the market looks like Is that going to all wait until the venture is finalized,3,45,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044444444444444446,0.0,0.91294643,13.33,15527.86476,11,1.151150773,8.2013,2014-Jul-31,HIG
And the volume drawdown that you 're expecting in {DATE} that 's more a function of your SKU reductions and those sorts of {DATE} or have you begun to hear any push back from your retailer saying hey that pricing 's too aggressive so we 're not taking as many new products or something like that,2,56,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.679014813,16.95,4993.698,11,0.237668884,8.564219999999999,2014-Aug-01,AIV
Does going from a predominantly variable to a more fixed cost product change materially in any way the way you think about collateral needs to provide that product And are there any kind of credit issues we should think about in terms of maybe seeing more lines drawn in the interim period while you service those contracts leading up into the heating seasons,2,63,0,0.0,0.015873015873015872,0.031746031746031744,0.015873015873015872,0.0,0.679014813,16.95,4993.698,11,0.237668884,8.564219999999999,2014-Aug-01,AIV

It seems like this has become a bit of a theme and that Crown did something that 's conceptually around the same idea Are you thinking about extending this to sort of all your customers and maybe just reshaping the way your lease agreements are structured and the pacing of cash flows,2,52,0,0.0,0.019230769230769232,0.038461538461538464,0.0,0.0,1.037727886,15.12,8993.544721,3,0.0065599690000000006,0.7469,2014-Aug-05,TDG
Hello Good {TIME} Actually just a follow up to the prior question Can you give us some benchmark as to what are the average rate increases that you are getting on the cases that you are renewing,4,37,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02702702702702703,0.02702702702702703,1.037727886,15.12,8993.544721,3,0.0065599690000000006,0.7469,2014-Aug-05,TDG
Great So {DATE} from a hip and knee perspective you 've got an extra selling day and you 've got some easier comps and we 're all going to be busy trying to adjust for those items But I was wondering if you could help us in that regard When you look at your hip and knee sales rates on kind of a {DATE} sales basis in versus do you think the volume of procedures is roughly flat in terms of the level of or was there an uptick sequentially,5,90,0,0.0,0.011111111111111112,0.022222222222222223,0.022222222222222223,0.0,1.037727886,15.12,8993.544721,3,0.0065599690000000006,0.7469,2014-Aug-05,TDG
Got it And then in high speed data any feedback from subs with your move to the higher cap of {CARDINAL} megs and the related data usage plans,2,28,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.072920603,15.12,9305.05225,8,1.114060254,0.8528100000000001,2014-Aug-05,AEE
Hey guys It 's actually Steve Forbes on for John {DATE} Just a couple quick questions The sequential improvement in gross margin {DATE} is that tied to getting more pricing through or a conscious effort to pull back on some promotional spending,4,42,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.023809523809523808,0.023809523809523808,0.7706406490000001,15.12,19120.60254,11,0.646105563,1.12391,2014-Aug-05,HCP
Okay So it is mostly just a mix shift issue And then on the horizontal Wolfberry program that you highlighted should we think about that the way that you have seen the New Mexico Shelf where you had envisioned that eventually replacing a portion of the vertical program there Do you have any early comments on what the well costs and EURs would look like in the horizontals there,4,69,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7469593109999999,15.12,8285.8897,5,0.209088058,0.73602,2014-Aug-05,IFF
Okay All right Fair enough And then on the perm margins they were the strongest they 've been in a while I assume that 's just the slowdown in headcount growth but as you grow in line with revenue as you talked about for {DATE} is this a good area to be in {PERCENT} operating margin Or is that number sort of over maybe a little higher than it should be because of the no headcount growth {DATE} and then it comes down,7,83,0,0.0,0.012048192771084338,0.024096385542168676,0.024096385542168676,0.012048192771084338,1.1145857,16.87,16516.018480000002,6,0.448298347,1.7454599999999998,2014-Aug-06,SYMC
I first wanted just to go back to these potential large contract awards that you talked about potentially coming through in {DATE} First in terms of mix are you seeing more of that on the pipeline side or the transmission side and can you talk about if you 're seeing more of the opportunities in Canada or the U.S. And then in conjunction with that {DATE} you talked about needing to pick up some additional work to hit your pipeline targets Does what you 're looking at here get you comfortably there,4,92,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.010869565217391304,0.0,0.90501454,16.87,10288.16712,8,0.892076,1.45961,2014-Aug-06,CNP
{DATE} Tony maybe just some housekeeping on {DATE} In the earnings guidance what is sort of the buyback that is implied and what is the tax rate,3,27,0,0.0,0.037037037037037035,0.037037037037037035,0.0,0.0,1.292591361,16.87,22503.22963,7,1.180493337,2.48495,2014-Aug-06,CTL
That really is the nature of the question is that you wonder if there might be a time one {DATE} down the road where your sauces your broths and then your cooking condensed varieties together get to a scale and they are on trend with the {DATE} eating patterns that that could be a high margin sort of savior to your growth whereas some of your other growth areas are lower margin in nature I wonder if that if you see that getting to critical scale within some time horizon Is that a fair question,3,95,0,0.0,0.021052631578947368,0.021052631578947368,0.0,0.031578947368421054,1.327834908,16.87,30425.261,4,1.006878398,0.04393,2014-Aug-06,DVN
And is there some thoughts on the pace of bringing that coverage ratio down to really drive what I 'm looking at on the MPC side the GP distributions and the IDRs,1,32,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.654399883,16.37,11773.88676,11,0.337181563,0.79368,2014-Aug-07,ESS
Hi guys Good {TIME} Thanks so much for taking the question Bob first question is on the margins If I think about what 's going to be necessary to get you back in line with the target model what of the {CARDINAL} mix scale or lower component cost how would you rank order those drivers in terms of the importance of getting your margin model back to where you want it to be,5,73,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0136986301369863,0.0273972602739726,0.654399883,16.37,11773.88676,11,0.337181563,0.79368,2014-Aug-07,ESS
To elaborate on the sales cycle I think if I was reading through the release right {DATE} maybe was the average commencement time between signings and actual commencements so I do n't know if that was a mix issue or are you seeing greater demand coming through fast any color would be helpful,1,53,0,0.0,0.018867924528301886,0.018867924528301886,0.018867924528301886,0.0,0.89469655,16.37,49393.43208,8,1.105661494,2.56229,2014-Aug-07,DUK
Okay And then on the implied {DATE} guidance it looks like your revenue sequential revenue is declining {PERCENT} I think that compares to about {PERCENT} over {DATE} Obviously always different dynamics here but as you are looking at the sequential behavior across energy particularly in the other businesses is that indicative of your believing that you are pretty close to bottoming out or how are you thinking about that,4,69,0,0.014492753623188406,0.0,0.014492753623188406,0.0,0.014492753623188406,1.755481706,16.37,15219.45194,4,0.448677123,0.82573,2014-Aug-07,CXO

Hi yes this is actually Dan Brims in for Brian {DATE} I have {CARDINAL} quick question I think I might have missed it Did you mention what the gross to net was going to be for KALYDECO as well as what your gross to net is for INCIVEK right now,3,50,0,0.0,0.02,0.02,0.0,0.04,1.727385669,16.37,6788.985,6,0.268265329,1.97867,2014-Aug-07,TDC
Thank you Kent {DATE} EPO utilization was flat It was flat again here in {DATE} It sounds like you 're still expecting it to be slightly up Is this continuing just to be from what physicians are saying Or is there some hard evidence this is occurring,6,47,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.727385669,16.37,6788.985,6,0.268265329,1.97867,2014-Aug-07,TDC
I 'm sorry {CARDINAL} clarification Steve You said the breakdown of the growth was similar in terms of how much was ACA in {DATE} versus {DATE} Obviously {DATE} growth was great but not as significant as {DATE} growth especially in the Acute Care business Should I take that to mean your ACA benefit in your mind declined in terms of absolute dollar benefit sequentially,4,64,0,0.0,0.0,0.015625,0.046875,0.03125,1.727385669,16.37,6788.985,6,0.268265329,1.97867,2014-Aug-07,TDC
Thank you for that I guess Gerry just kind of on the {MONEY} of spending as you guys see it with the rules coming {DATE} and relatively tight timelines when do you think that starts creeping into the CapEx program and starts eking its way onto the EPS growth rate slides,3,51,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8650252279999999,16.37,23867.77575,8,0.631368273,0.55721,2014-Aug-07,SRE
Okay Great Thanks And then just switching to wood products can you quantify and I think you said the lower earnings in {DATE} was coming from lower sales volumes the previous operating rates and then the maintenance and OSB Could you roughly break out how much each {CARDINAL} of those would contribute to the decline,6,55,0,0.0,0.01818181818181818,0.03636363636363636,0.01818181818181818,0.03636363636363636,0.8650252279999999,16.37,23867.77575,8,0.631368273,0.55721,2014-Aug-07,SRE

Hi and thanks for taking my call I wanted to go back to this question about M&A that you might have been looking at and passed on How much of your guidance for {DATE} is dependent on completing any kind of new acquisition or are you basing that entirely on what you have {DATE},3,54,0,0.0,0.018518518518518517,0.037037037037037035,0.0,0.018518518518518517,0.883151007,16.37,6141.47232,8,0.942248537,0.72404,2014-Aug-07,LNT

Okay And then on the volume front I think it sounds like it is fair to say things are kind of bumping along the bottom but can you just talk about the trends {DATE} as you went through {DATE} and into kind of realtime whether things are getting better worse or indifferent,2,52,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.019230769230769232,0.019230769230769232,0.865053805,14.23,18738.57564,11,0.5385062860000001,1.281,2014-Aug-12,VTR
And if I could just ask {CARDINAL} follow up with renewals that you booked {DATE} can you give us a context in terms of what the tenor was in terms of volume commitments pricing that you had to pricing concessions perhaps that you gave to retain business,1,47,0,0.0,0.0425531914893617,0.0425531914893617,0.0,0.0,1.214479938,12.9,11424.79899,9,0.595342289,1.66465,2014-Aug-14,KSS
Thanks very much and good {TIME} George just following up on that line of questioning Can you talk about when a customer does file for bankruptcy or closes stores and sales primarily move to someone else or in the case of Drug Fair in New Jersey where Walgreen 's buys it how much of that volume do you generally pick up,3,61,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01639344262295082,0.03278688524590164,1.028009857,12.9,18256.03758,6,0.326011615,6.418080000000002,2014-Aug-14,A
{DATE} Okay When you mention that the capacity plan was sort of in flux for {DATE} and I mean understandably so I just wanted to get a little bit of context around what kind of improvement you might need to see in order to believe you 're going to dial the capacity levels back up from where you 're now going down to as you move into {DATE} Is there any way to calibrate what kind of revenue environment would it take to be thinking that you would be adding capacity or is it,6,94,0,0.0,0.010638297872340425,0.02127659574468085,0.010638297872340425,0.0,1.5725172509999998,12.32,37746.8168,9,0.115627844,1.77004,2014-Aug-19,TJX
Yes you did n't book very many PUDs as a relative ratio to the peers for sure The other question just since you hit it on BM additional exploration can you just talk about the prospect and the timing just so we know what you 're doing there,2,48,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.020833333333333332,0.975537228,11.78,12634.84856,1,0.288957354,2.58198,2014-Aug-21,HRL
Well as a follow up if your operating rates are let 's say the low {DATE} and let 's say you want to aim for I 'll just pick a number the {CARDINAL} area it would take {DATE} to get there given your volume growth rates So am I missing something in terms of the opportunity for capacity declines,2,59,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01694915254237288,0.01694915254237288,0.975537228,11.78,12634.84856,1,0.288957354,2.58198,2014-Aug-21,HRL
{CARDINAL} okay that 's up from {DATE} Okay and then on the excess deposits Ed in your comments on the net interest margin did you include any more aggressive investment of the FX deposits I guess if they stick around a little bit longer is there a possibility you could invest that in longer duration or do your assumptions basically assume continued very short investment in those excess deposits,5,69,0,0.0,0.014492753623188406,0.057971014492753624,0.0,0.0,1.312698408,11.76,7606.72129,9,0.447850356,6.30895,2014-Aug-22,FL

Great Then looking at kind of your {CARDINAL} guidance and comparing it to your {CARDINAL} guidance dry gas production is getting {MONEY} of CapEx in {CARDINAL} Then in {CARDINAL} you did n't adjust that production guidance down from what you gave us at Is there going to be an uptick in CapEx to dry gas production at this point or is that the anticipated plan,4,65,0,0.0,0.0,0.015384615384615385,0.015384615384615385,0.0,1.3722070469999998,14.12,35036.55173,6,0.251981819,1.46474,2014-Sep-16,ADBE

Last quick {CARDINAL} Goodrich you said you still expect to close at {DATE} and yet given that the EC is gone into Phase II is it maybe more likely that {DATE} would be {DATE} which is still near {DATE} maybe you can update us there,2,45,0,0.0,0.044444444444444446,0.044444444444444446,0.0,0.0,0.962815202,13.69,23907.46066,12,0.876331484,5.99181,2014-Sep-23,CCL

Thank you If I can go back to Eliquis can you frame out the earliest best case timeline for answering the complete response letter I 'm wondering if it could be as quick as something like {DATE} I would imagine there are certain physical limitations on how long it would take to validate data and trial sites but I just do n't know what that would be And then going back to dapagliflozin in Europe given the positive opinion in {DATE} it seems like you should have already received final approval and I 'm wondering if additional questions have come up in Europe kind of like they have in the US And can you confirm that the major regulatory issue at this point in the US is the cancer signal,7,130,0,0.007692307692307693,0.007692307692307693,0.015384615384615385,0.015384615384615385,0.015384615384615385,0.959043146,16.71,4690.44615,12,0.255573113,3.03481,2014-Oct-02,GPN
Good {TIME} A couple of questions {CARDINAL} on Todd what you were going through with regard to actions that you could take to manage the denominator I was intrigued by your comments on your view that you could lower the deposits without impacting business lower your commitments without impacting your business Could you give a little more color on how you are thinking about doing that,6,66,0,0.0,0.045454545454545456,0.045454545454545456,0.015151515151515152,0.015151515151515152,0.85793553,17.2,56776.80862,5,0.149392998,0.84809,2014-Oct-08,MON
And {CARDINAL} final question if I may Just looking at the thermography business historically that 's been a good 's been {DATE} for that business You have what looks like a pretty good slate of new products that are hitting the market Some improvement on the macro side in Europe How should we think about thermography in,5,57,0,0.0,0.017543859649122806,0.017543859649122806,0.05263157894736842,0.017543859649122806,1.049503813,24.64,218756.103,11,0.910600717,0.43469,2014-Oct-14,JPM

Question on margins Seems like really the underwriting margins have been the main driver for earnings growth in the last in the foreseeable or in the recent past Is that story pretty much over or are there other levers to pull further improve margins,3,44,0,0.0,0.0,0.022727272727272728,0.022727272727272728,0.022727272727272728,1.335798032,22.79,32596.04292,12,0.659606012,2.16234,2014-Oct-15,CSX
All right My follow up let me choose at Uinta did you in {DATE} when you previously talked about it you talked about that weighting of SXLs being more Uteland Butte than Wasatch Is that still the plan And can you tell us what your well costs run out there versus what you think a target well cost may be,5,60,0,0.0,0.016666666666666666,0.016666666666666666,0.0,0.0,1.10078522,26.25,6656.4921,3,0.354603004,3.11578,2014-Oct-16,SNA

Right Okay And then that 's the second part of my question is I think Bob you mentioned second {CARDINAL} Energy revenues similar to the {CARDINAL} run rates In the past you 've said you expected to be the trough on Energy revenues so it sounds like might be the trough so if you 'd just clarify that point and then secondly,5,62,0,0.0,0.016129032258064516,0.016129032258064516,0.0,0.016129032258064516,0.832101275,26.25,30089.77684,10,0.332501025,0.85635,2014-Oct-16,SYK

That 's helpful And then a follow up question if I could What is going to be the gross margin impact of that higher price Is it going to be offset with more spending on Blu ray product or is it actually going to be something that boosts the gross margin,4,51,0,0.0,0.0196078431372549,0.0196078431372549,0.0,0.0196078431372549,1.255289196,26.25,15500.58796,11,0.753596252,2.7323,2014-Oct-16,FITB
Yes good {TIME} Thank you for taking my question I guess first question in terms of your outlook for orders I was hoping you could walk through the various segments provide some color as to what you 're seeing Clearly on display and EES I would n't imagine too much upbeat commentary But would love to hear your thoughts particularly around silicon and service as you think {DATE},5,68,0,0.014705882352941176,0.014705882352941176,0.014705882352941176,0.014705882352941176,0.029411764705882353,1.064073452,25.2,18550.90384,11,1.042783061,3.48977,2014-Oct-17,STI
Murry specifically on that Marcellus well that is just an impressive well You identified a few things and it sounded like there was something unique about Green County that you all think has contributed to that Specifically is there anything else you can point to from a geological stand point in the area Shale thickness organic content,4,57,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.017543859649122806,0.0,0.869980348,25.2,15329.17056,11,0.68603202,1.38718,2014-Oct-17,MTB
{MONEY} okay So just wondering why the other part the crystal and silicon side is just running flattish why we have n't seen growth Is {DATE} like a seasonally slow period for crystal and silicon or is there some other explanation why we 're not seeing growth there outside of thin fab,3,52,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.019230769230769232,0.994608288,21.99,27486.99976,1,0.237879768,0.97061,2014-Oct-20,VFC

Yes just a quick question here on the Edwards Trend Just trying to get a sense of what you think is timing is in terms of bringing infrastructure in and getting some production bumps There are sort of a couple of points in time you guys are looking at when you can get some of that behind power production increased here,3,61,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01639344262295082,1.503417252,18.57,6422.7602,12,0.161159425,5.15805,2014-Oct-21,RHI
You said that costs in {DATE} would be {MONEY} higher than in {DATE} Do you think they will be higher or are you assuming they are going to be higher in {DATE} because of delays in the costs hitting your P&L,2,41,0,0.0,0.0,0.024390243902439025,0.0,0.024390243902439025,0.863491608,18.57,31598.9008,11,0.774732401,2.1913400000000003,2014-Oct-21,TRV

Comp guidance for {DATE} is that reflective of current trends Is it just built in conservatism or is there some sort of calendar shift that we need to be aware of and then I guess related to calendar just curious on the timing of the Anniversary Sale I know it kind of shifts around from time to time or rather {DATE} just wondering how we should be thinking about that {DATE},3,71,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.265387347,16.08,47211.7481,6,0.458163861,1.58115,2014-Oct-22,TMO

Hi good {TIME} everyone And congrats on pulling this through on the cost side Could you get into a little more Doug in terms of SG&A I know that there were a few things that helped that you said were timing related Should we still be thinking that SG&A dollars {DATE} could grow maybe {PERCENT} or {PERCENT} or is it possible to actually keep it flat or even slightly down,5,70,0,0.0,0.05714285714285714,0.05714285714285714,0.014285714285714285,0.0,1.52163303,16.08,15615.55262,6,0.202675405,2.5510200000000003,2014-Oct-22,APH

Since you are at {CARDINAL} {DATE} and you are saying that margin has hopefully now largely stabilized does that suggest you could be closer to the high end of the range Or does stabilized mean you are not going to see {CARDINAL} basis points because there were a lot of unusual factors {DATE} and the pace continues down but just at a much more manageable pace,3,66,0,0.0,0.030303030303030304,0.045454545454545456,0.030303030303030304,0.0,1.377154329,17.87,95899.15608,12,0.461935077,0.48779,2014-Oct-23,UNP

Hi So my question really is on the ental operating margin it fell {CARDINAL} points sequentially I know a lot of that was on the SG&A side just from the added headcount that you have but I was hoping maybe you could give a little more color on what your expectations are for and really for {DATE} Do we is it wrong for us to assume that things get better from here or do they hover at this level,4,79,0,0.0,0.02531645569620253,0.0379746835443038,0.012658227848101266,0.02531645569620253,1.073338134,16.53,4241.44515,6,0.38362722,0.74556,2014-Oct-24,FLIR
Jim in talking about that {CARDINAL} Korean customer obviously your guidance here has a decent amount of variability for shipments out of SCP dependent on a what happens with that customer Can you give us a little bit of color as to what 's on the flat side versus the down {PERCENT} side Is it sort of a share recovery expectation on {CARDINAL} side Or is it that share would remain the same at sort of new levels with that customer,4,81,0,0.0,0.0,0.024691358024691357,0.0,0.0,1.073338134,16.53,4241.44515,6,0.38362722,0.74556,2014-Oct-24,FLIR

And then Paul a little bit on the sales trends you saw in {DATE} If I remember there were some nuances of a day shift in terms of sales I thought we might get back in {DATE} And it seems like we did n't if we look at the comp store sales Could you help us understand that flattish comp versus up a little bit in {DATE} What really drove that sequential decline,6,73,0,0.0,0.0273972602739726,0.0410958904109589,0.0,0.0136986301369863,0.970923563,15.15,6575.90024,11,0.361292424,5.21552,2014-Oct-30,EXR

Yes there is a couple of different way you can look at the margins I can work through that Just on the merchant segment some of the pricing pressure you are seeing is that an industry phenomenon bundled to unbundled or is that something that you 're just specifically seeing in your niche of clients,3,55,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.949276049,14.73,20165.18295,11,0.646105563,2.16169,2014-Nov-04,HCP

And just {CARDINAL} last one on Grocery Just can you talk a little bit about the environment Obviously the center of the store is quite pressured and we have heard that a lot at CAGNY but I do n't think it is clear to anybody really why the consumer is so strapped especially on their food purchases So what is your read on that situation,4,65,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.949276049,14.73,20165.18295,11,0.646105563,2.16169,2014-Nov-04,HCP

Okay And then the {CARDINAL} basis points of the product line exits I want to go back to the original guidance I think you gave us was that {CARDINAL} of product line exits would come from SKU discontinuation and third from the sale of the businesses or the sale of the products Has that ratio changed and I am just wondering how the timing of that is going to flow,4,70,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.014285714285714285,0.846502498,14.73,20797.0353,11,0.327657133,1.03346,2014-Nov-04,VNO

First question is just it 's more strategic I know you went over a lot of your international growth plans at your analyst day in {DATE} But just in general was curious we could see in {DATE} that sales or overall sales from your new global snacking business is obviously a higher percentage of your total Company sales If we just think that that category over {DATE} should continue to outpace what we 're seeing in soup and the second pillar of your {CARDINAL} category or your {CARDINAL} tier growth processes international growth could it be fair to assume that over the longer term that growth internationally may assume some non organic growth in global snacking Would you potentially look to enter new markets to find that growth that we 've seen in a number of other snacking businesses,5,139,0,0.0,0.02158273381294964,0.03597122302158273,0.0,0.007194244604316547,2.210811145,14.89,9241.7364,4,0.5995821139999999,0.21148000000000006,2014-Nov-05,XEC

Good {TIME} I wanted to ask you about the pipeline and the impact that that could have on originations If you look at {DATE} your pipeline converted into originations at about a {CARDINAL} ratio So in other words whatever you had in pipeline you originated {PERCENT} more in {DATE} With a {MONEY} pipeline will that equate to north of it puts you {MONEY} in originations in {DATE} Is that anywhere close to where you think you could see the numbers,6,80,0,0.0,0.025,0.025,0.0125,0.0,2.24178174,14.89,64087.05492,12,0.521575528,3.766480000000001,2014-Nov-05,TWX

Maybe just {CARDINAL} follow up on that then Can you quantify the {DATE} buy in on condensed soup I believe there is a {PERCENT} price increase in {DATE} for condensed and that the retailers bought in ahead of that hence the significant growth in condensed I assume that that negatively hits volumes in {DATE} but can you give us some quantification of what the magnitude you expect to happen in {DATE},4,71,0,0.0,0.014084507042253521,0.04225352112676056,0.0,0.014084507042253521,1.843369707,14.89,22917.782000000007,4,1.006878398,1.25506,2014-Nov-05,DVN
I 'll also add my congratulations on some nice growth and best wishes to you Freeman I wanted to follow up on the gross margin topic there while we are on it Big picture wise is there any reason why you should n't be able to eventually get back to your lower markdowns to the {PERCENT} levels that we saw {DATE},3,61,0,0.01639344262295082,0.0,0.0,0.03278688524590164,0.01639344262295082,1.168702566,14.89,10590.17344,8,0.892076,0.43549,2014-Nov-05,CNP
I guess Paul quick question just on how we should think about gross margins from here Maybe a follow on from Lothar 's question around utilization I guess even if I adjust for the higher depreciation level {DATE} versus prior periods given that you 've had such a good mix shift away from more commoditized markets I 'm still a little bit surprised that gross margins have n't done better And I know I 'm kind of splitting hairs here given how strong your absolute gross margins are But as we think about the product mix utilization is there any reason why your model should n't be able to get back to gross margins in {DATE} instead of {DATE},5,119,0,0.0,0.008403361344537815,0.008403361344537815,0.03361344537815126,0.01680672268907563,1.732751238,14.89,11752.1695,8,0.33283439600000003,0.96642,2014-Nov-05,OKE

Okay and my other question would relate to I know you do n't give guidance around the {DATE} progressions But a couple of the other companies have gone out of their way to signal that we should take into account the moving parts in {DATE} Now you signaled something on the weather in the psych business maybe the layout on your acute care side does n't get as impacted by weather as some others But do you think this is a normal {DATE} layout for you guys {DATE} or would you caution us {DATE} in any way,4,97,0,0.0,0.010309278350515464,0.010309278350515464,0.0,0.020618556701030927,1.580692227,14.17,6364.3,6,0.268265329,1.30792,2014-Nov-06,TDC

Thank you Doug can you walk through a little bit on how you 're underwriting vacant assets and assets with a lot of lease up For example it 's pretty easy to take the purchase price the deferred CapEx the TIs and leasing commission How are you dealing with all of the OpEx carry and an imputed cost of capital in order to arrive at your basis and a stabilized return on cost,4,73,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0273972602739726,0.0,1.497597325,13.99,42643.65068,9,0.115627844,0.02672,2014-Nov-18,TJX

Thank you And Jeff I guess you and I talked a little about this at Niacon a little bit At what point do you look at the pricing structure of how you go to market and maybe look more towards a variable pricing method either including surcharges or some sort of index pricing methodology to make it easier for you to continue to pass along the dramatic inflation that you are seeing Are we anywhere near there or are there issues with that that make it very difficult to do so,5,91,0,0.0,0.01098901098901099,0.02197802197802198,0.01098901098901099,0.01098901098901099,1.482980315,13.96,13446.4911,6,0.194648563,1.6914900000000002,2014-Nov-20,ADSK

Okay thanks for that clarification Last is just a housekeeping item You chastised analysts for not getting the income expense line right and I 'm just curious is there anything else You just have this other line and historically you 've had things like government grants et cetera in there Is there anything else that 's in that line or is it pretty much all just interest income versus net interest expense,7,72,0,0.0,0.0,0.013888888888888888,0.0,0.0,0.920173641,16.81,17325.037,12,0.123702249,1.05953,2014-Dec-19,PAYX

My question is on the cause to DRAM pricing You 're guiding to flat quarter to date and we have seen recent upward movement in the contract pricing on the DN side Could you help us understand that,3,38,0,0.0,0.02631578947368421,0.02631578947368421,0.0,0.02631578947368421,1.3837604019999998,21.48,168683.858,11,1.191457873,0.57105,2015-Jan-15,BAC
And Matt in terms of the timing you touched on it to some extent is it fair to assume that the branch consolidation will be some of the faster moving operations So is that the biggest driver of the increase to {MONEY} from {MONEY} or are there other factors that we should be thinking about,2,55,0,0.0,0.0,0.01818181818181818,0.0,0.0,1.3837604019999998,21.48,168683.858,11,1.191457873,0.57105,2015-Jan-15,BAC
Ted on incrementals just when you look at on a year over year basis a little bit below our expectations And just was thinking of in terms of commodity headwind that was pretty significant {DATE} at this time and you put through prices as {DATE} went on What was the spread on price costs in {DATE} and did that have any positive benefit on margin {DATE},3,66,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.030303030303030304,0.0,1.404587145,22.39,19142.64976,11,0.986066846,5.92486,2015-Jan-16,STI
Okay And then just looking at the guidance for the loss ratio and the expense ratio moving higher obviously versus {DATE} ex cats Is this a function of captives that market possibly driving margin down a little bit,3,38,0,0.0,0.02631578947368421,0.02631578947368421,0.0,0.02631578947368421,1.230132246,20.95,15196.84336,11,0.668087943,0.8125100000000001,2015-Jan-20,MTB
Okay Fair enough And then last question if I could just I just wanted to make sure I understood on energy marketing at OKE this reclassification Was that basically something that was previously a LOCOM and is now sort of a mark to market loss and maybe we 'll get some of that money back And whether it 's {DATE} Or is that just more sort of an outright loss,6,70,0,0.0,0.02857142857142857,0.02857142857142857,0.0,0.04285714285714286,1.230132246,20.95,15196.84336,11,0.668087943,0.8125100000000001,2015-Jan-20,MTB

That 's helpful And then the {MONEY} I think you had put in your original guidance for additional CapEx {DATE} tying that out to Page {CARDINAL} on the supplemental line enhancements and other nonrecurring does that suggest the {MONEY} is down from the {MONEY} that you kind of quoted in {DATE} or is that {MONEY} on top of that number,2,60,0,0.0,0.016666666666666666,0.016666666666666666,0.016666666666666666,0.0,2.0912915130000003,20.95,38365.37544,12,0.217098691,0.28222,2015-Jan-20,DAL
Yes that 's very helpful Thank you Then maybe just back to maybe thinking about RAS accumulation margins In the past you 've talked about a {PERCENT} to {PERCENT} longer term target We 've been pretty far above that for {DATE} Obviously the equity market has helped But I think perhaps other things that have changed are kind of continued scale being built in the Principal Funds business and margin expansion there Can you comment on {PERCENT} Do you think it 's reasonable to expect maybe that range could be higher longer term at this point,9,96,0,0.0,0.052083333333333336,0.052083333333333336,0.0,0.0,1.416248211,19.89,9175.0925,6,0.15754960199999998,3.83948,2015-Jan-21,FFIV

You typically place a lot of instruments at {DATE} and I think this is a little bit more pronounced in and than it is in and but with that as the premise of my question did the timing of the deterioration in the broader markets lead to any delay in instrument bookings in {DATE},1,54,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05555555555555555,1.392668281,18.85,8023.92,12,0.483557357,0.3971,2015-Jan-22,NAVI
Fair enough Fair enough Maybe I could just ask {CARDINAL} on the resurfacing side You mentioned your training surgeons {DATE} is there any metrics you can give us around that How many surgeons you have trained If we can expect these guys to start ordering implants here in {DATE},6,49,0,0.0,0.04081632653061224,0.04081632653061224,0.0,0.0,0.8156213440000001,18.85,34800.314,11,0.7282244440000001,4.53759,2015-Jan-22,TRV
Second question and you just referred to this a little bit Jeff but in North America it looks like the value brands you might have lost some share and then Latin America looks like it lost share again Was that a result of the increased pricing Or os that something fundamentally happening in the industry And at what point do you expect the share particularly in North America and Latin America to stabilize,4,73,0,0.0,0.0136986301369863,0.0136986301369863,0.0136986301369863,0.0410958904109589,2.34734862,18.85,25543.40391,12,0.15914869,0.24344,2015-Jan-22,UAL
Ok Then just {CARDINAL} last question on Camel Snus Is the roll out the national roll out complete now Is it in every point of sale where you want it to be,4,32,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03125,1.175594532,18.85,25671.42072,11,0.775476042,0.94174,2015-Jan-22,BBT
Good {TIME} Some great results Can you just talk about that the SCOOP oil curve and versus the results I mean that well the well results are substantially above that curve Is there were you pumping that so that it 's running above the type curve and should fall back down Or is there just sort of an early indication that maybe your curve is way to conservative,6,68,0,0.0,0.014705882352941176,0.014705882352941176,0.029411764705882353,0.0,1.799182131,18.85,6369.79146,11,0.766071472,0.53315,2015-Jan-22,ETFC
Terrific thank you I wanted to give you a chance to discuss outsourcing more You mentioned that existing customers drove {PERCENT} of the growth but you also added the {CARDINAL} new logos Is outsourcing still on the rise and that 's what 's supporting that {PERCENT} figure and similarly are the {CARDINAL} new logos a sign that those companies are perhaps outsourcing for the first time,6,66,0,0.0,0.015151515151515152,0.015151515151515152,0.0,0.0,1.799182131,18.85,6369.79146,11,0.766071472,0.53315,2015-Jan-22,ETFC
Okay And then the second Could you just I guess with this pick up in extra earnings are you guys just being cautious for the rest of {DATE} or is there some stuff which I guess I saw in the graph you are going to do something extra to mitigate this {MONEY} or {MONEY} extra that you picked up in {DATE},3,61,0,0.0,0.01639344262295082,0.03278688524590164,0.0,0.0,1.281707021,18.85,7919.8008,11,0.696054988,0.32697,2015-Jan-22,HBAN
Thanks I 'm hoping you can put something in context for me with regard to Pennsylvania The PPL utilities did their first bridge auction recently began sourcing power {DATE} to customers and that price was depending on how you look at it in the low to {DATE} for the generating companies that won that bid Can you help us understand as we look at your {DATE} situation how much load for FE actually goes to market that 's currently being served by FirstEnergy Services and if you were pricing in this market looking at that auction can you give us a sense of what the price might be {DATE},4,109,0,0.0,0.01834862385321101,0.01834862385321101,0.0,0.009174311926605505,1.281707021,18.85,7919.8008,11,0.696054988,0.32697,2015-Jan-22,HBAN
Good {TIME} License sales what percentage of revenue is that now That 's still an area of softness and you guys expected it to be soft but now with CheckFree in there can you give us a sense of how big that is,4,43,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.023255813953488372,0.0,1.333954612,18.85,18963.192,10,0.174562962,2.2482,2015-Jan-22,ISRG
John you had mentioned I think the possibility of some pricing {DATE} in the U.S. And thinking about that can you give us some sense as to what percent of your contracts actually might come up for renewal in {DATE} in the U.S.,2,43,0,0.0,0.023255813953488372,0.046511627906976744,0.0,0.0,2.238426259,18.85,28391.86152,12,0.350947904,0.99416,2015-Jan-22,LUV
Okay very good And then {CARDINAL} question on wages and compensation I just want to make sure I understand that the {MONEY} paid during {DATE} was {CARDINAL} time That was a catch up payment There is not any other lump sum payments to be made And then secondly could you walk us through what to expect in terms of labor inflation for {DATE},6,63,0,0.0,0.015873015873015872,0.015873015873015872,0.015873015873015872,0.015873015873015872,0.867155639,16.4,44314.6959,3,0.031176766,0.83899,2015-Jan-23,KMB
The {CARDINAL} thing a lot of these securities are trading way below {MONEY} Just on where they 're trading the average is so much lower Is there a fair amount of discretion being used,3,34,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.708138152,16.4,12547.932,12,0.3641638,1.63425,2015-Jan-23,KSU
I guess my first question was around some of the commentary you made on the Haynesville When you look sort of further out {DATE} time what do you believe the Haynesville could contribute to your volumes I guess the second question I had was on the AUR that you mentioned what sort of {DATE} {DATE} decline would you need to see to make that number achievable,4,66,0,0.0,0.015151515151515152,0.030303030303030304,0.0,0.045454545454545456,1.114801721,16.4,77803.4859,2,0.228935386,1.58099,2015-Jan-23,HON
What that means Rick is that you are reasonably comfortable maintaining the bookings revenue rate as you proceed through {DATE} That 's basically what that would imply if you want to grow {PERCENT} {DATE},2,34,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.179998724,16.66,57627.28262000001,6,0.192805619,0.22913000000000006,2015-Jan-26,TXN
Maybe if I can this is Michael Bilerman speaking if you think about the {MONEY} development that you want to start in {DATE} you are obviously thinking about what the forward rents are going to be in {DATE} and {DATE} as you get comfortable with starting that development What sort of trajectory are you assuming in terms of rents from the current basis as you compare that to comparable acquisition in your market that you may have more confidence in,2,80,0,0.0,0.025,0.0375,0.0,0.0,1.533367344,16.66,5036.80215,11,1.099786718,2.98756,2015-Jan-26,ZION
Okay Turning to the margins I guess a couple of things There is obviously some major muscle movements that happened during {DATE} with McKechnie coming in diluting {DATE} and then taking a lot of cost out and getting the margins up through {DATE} As we think about seasonality in the business is it fair to say that maybe net putting aside the acquisition impact as we think about I guess adjust adjusted EBITDA margins that there really is n't a heck of a lot of seasonality and that {DATE} was just really just impacted by McKechnie,4,96,0,0.0,0.010416666666666666,0.010416666666666666,0.0,0.0,1.080127585,15.52,47903.8995,8,0.619647215,0.63902,2015-Jan-27,NEE

And then the positive swing that you saw I guess Company wide in PR any driver behind that It may be a client win or is that general improvement in that segment,2,32,0,0.0,0.03125,0.03125,0.09375,0.0,1.051475815,15.52,35013.60855,10,0.254313771,1.21171,2015-Jan-27,SYK
What are you seeing in {DATE} of where you are right now that could lead to deceleration from the quarter to date ID and comp sale that they have seen so far Your implied guidance suggests a slowdown in performance I am just curious what you 're seeing that would lead to that,3,53,0,0.0,0.03773584905660377,0.03773584905660377,0.0,0.018867924528301886,1.275519903,15.52,6480.40428,6,0.303251873,4.75002,2015-Jan-27,TSS
Thanks and follow up question for Stacy Just a clarification on the gross margin Stacy So you 've given us what the utilization rates underutilization costs look like If we look at typical seasonality for you guys are probably down like {MONEY} or something like that If sales are down {MONEY} and depreciation is up a little bit and start up costs are up can the margins be flat with current utilization rates and what would inventory look like,5,79,0,0.0,0.0,0.02531645569620253,0.0,0.02531645569620253,1.956339208,15.52,28967.09528,6,0.055176936,7.971710000000002,2015-Jan-27,ILMN
On PSM Mitch I think you mentioned negative mix as part of the EBIT variance Is that mostly because the growth rates in the emerging markets are stronger and that 's maybe some of the lower margin business that you 're referring to Or how should we think about that,3,50,0,0.0,0.02,0.04,0.02,0.02,1.293150887,15.52,30648.98568,3,0.672821042,3.43813,2015-Jan-27,GLW

Appreciate that detail Patty And then in pulp there 's been some recent price erosion on the softwood side in China even though the inventory seems to be in pretty good shape Do you have any thoughts on why we 've seen prices move lower in China And any visibility into the pulp price environment in China over {DATE},4,59,0,0.0,0.0,0.01694915254237288,0.01694915254237288,0.01694915254237288,2.257590502,15.52,38674.98875,12,0.054029366,0.4084,2015-Jan-27,AAL

Good {TIME} guys If you were to separate your business drivers into the controllables like your marketing and innovation and the factors outside your control in like the consumer environment weather disruption and even factors like the competition you 're seeing in healthy snacking do you see the net impact of the uncontrollables in as perhaps unusual in a way that creates easy or difficult comparisons as we think about,2,70,0,0.0,0.014285714285714285,0.02857142857142857,0.04285714285714286,0.02857142857142857,0.897490647,15.52,58787.21272,6,0.387275505,1.32639,2015-Jan-27,DHR

Hey good {TIME} guys A quick {CARDINAL} on your margin guidance it looks like in order to hit the middle of that range that {CARDINAL} you 're expecting maybe {CARDINAL} basis points of pressure per {DATE} Are you expecting that loan yields coming down are going to drive the bulk of that pressure in addition to maybe some of the runoff of the lower cost broker deposits you were talking about Is there any accretion roll off baked into that or debt issuance in that at all,4,87,0,0.0,0.022988505747126436,0.022988505747126436,0.011494252873563218,0.0,1.633216727,17.22,14546.14084,6,0.17696368399999998,4.79944,2015-Jan-28,ROK

Okay and then it sounded from the comments like you 're more open to cutting the dividend I just want to make sure that 's the right interpretation and then I guess it 's been somewhat surprising that there have n't been more dividend cuts across the industry Is there any focus or pressure from the regulators for the industry to kind of rationalize dividends to hunker down for a more difficult environment,4,73,0,0.0,0.0136986301369863,0.0136986301369863,0.0,0.0273972602739726,1.428248758,17.22,10971.78864,9,0.120335407,3.99695,2015-Jan-28,TSCO
That 's very helpful Steve I guess just switching gears to medical I believe the guidance that you are reaffirming {DATE} was actually given prior to the Cardinal announcement so as we think about the ramp of the expected synergies and savings from that arrangement which I know I think is expected to close in anything you can add just as part of how we should think about how additive that deal could be in your {DATE},3,77,0,0.0,0.012987012987012988,0.025974025974025976,0.0,0.0,1.428248758,17.22,10971.78864,9,0.120335407,3.99695,2015-Jan-28,TSCO

Okay The second thing is it looks like your Pressure Sensitive adhesives business has {MONEY} in revenues which I assume are sales of adhesives to Office Products Is there a long term agreement or some kind of agreement in place with {CARDINAL} M so that we might view those as ongoing sales Or once the business goes then those incremental revenues also go,4,63,0,0.0,0.015873015873015872,0.031746031746031744,0.0,0.0,1.908886554,20.44,4332.6471299999985,5,0.30186440600000003,0.8253,2015-Jan-29,ALB
Okay Actually one final quick question In the expectations {DATE} of {CARDINAL} to {CARDINAL} what 's the assumed AUM growth {DATE},3,21,0,0.0,0.0,0.047619047619047616,0.0,0.047619047619047616,1.964813206,20.44,35388.17568,10,0.089843724,0.38775,2015-Jan-29,ALXN
Great thanks Just to follow up on the gross margin question I was wondering if you could maybe speak to whether you did loosen up on any of your price investments at all in {DATE} And then also if maybe there were any noteworthy changes in performance by sales department,4,50,0,0.0,0.06,0.06,0.02,0.02,1.036012813,20.44,38025.17648,10,0.209605404,2.86499,2015-Jan-29,BAX
That is very helpful I appreciate the color on that {CARDINAL} question I had regarding the goal in terms of hitting your goals despite the environment you 're purely referring to what you 've laid out for {DATE} you were n't putting any kind of stake in the ground for {CARDINAL} i.e. you still expect to be able to grow earnings despite the environment because of the savings that you generate here Would that be fair that you 're only looking at {CARDINAL} right now in terms of promising on your goals,4,92,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03260869565217391,0.010869565217391304,1.128952638,20.44,28260.84518,9,0.291066068,3.76201,2015-Jan-29,CAH
Could you give us a little outlook on what free cash flow is going to look like once Canada is over on the {MONEY} of spend and where do you expect to deploy that Is it going to be tilted more towards share repurchase or how do you look at that,2,51,0,0.0,0.0196078431372549,0.0196078431372549,0.0,0.0,1.0343637490000002,20.44,17255.72,1,0.067662952,2.68329,2015-Jan-29,HSY
And how much was that I guess I am trying to get a feeling for how much of this increase is I guess an increase in sort of core investment in the Company versus comp increases versus like {CARDINAL} time charges,2,41,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0343637490000002,20.44,17255.72,1,0.067662952,2.68329,2015-Jan-29,HSY
And then in the Utica you talked about targeting {CARDINAL} net acres With gas prices having moved up and also chatter about some pretty strong results out of the dry gas window is that something that you would consider targeting in your leasing efforts Or are you still focused in the wet gas part of the play,3,57,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.017543859649122806,0.0,0.948189571,20.44,27592.97947,11,0.296359823,0.2263,2015-Jan-29,GGP
Okay A couple questions for Jack You had laid out some numbers in terms of what you thought you would generate in terms of we investable capital over {DATE} after the dividend cut and that that was sort of your sort of warchest for opportunities should they arise in the business Can you reiterate what those numbers were and have they dissipated significantly because of the downturn in the retail and wholesale power markets on the capacity outcome,4,78,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01282051282051282,0.038461538461538464,0.948189571,20.44,27592.97947,11,0.296359823,0.2263,2015-Jan-29,GGP

Thanks for the question So {CARDINAL} questions First on inflation As we look at the dairy cost curve dairy costs were meaningfully inflationary for you {DATE} but it does n't look like it gets a whole lot worse on a go forward of course barring any incremental moves from the spot rate Is that consistent with your view as well,5,60,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05,1.523122611,20.44,11429.64264,9,0.123996187,0.89076,2015-Jan-29,HBI

Hey good {TIME} guys It 's actually Mike Sang in for Nigel I did n't see capital deployment guidance and I apologize if you talked about it but you did n't change your free cash guidance but to the extent you do better on free cash {DATE} how should we think about where you 'll spend that incremental upside,3,59,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03389830508474576,0.0,1.536891356,18.76,22705.725,2,0.317998535,0.42659,2015-Jan-30,PCAR

Thank you for taking the question Following up on auto and dealer mark up How do you expect the industry to evolve Do you think over {DATE} we 're going to be going to the elimination of mark up do you think mark ups just come down do you think it 's kind of different for different players If you could kind of think {DATE} out what do you think the industry is going to be,6,76,0,0.0,0.013157894736842105,0.013157894736842105,0.0,0.013157894736842105,1.536891356,18.76,22705.725,2,0.317998535,0.42659,2015-Jan-30,PCAR
Okay And then Protiviti it seems like you saw the international piece pick up here I know you have mentioned internal audit But I guess is that piece of Protiviti starting to kick in like you have seen in the US or is it too early to say that,4,49,0,0.0,0.0,0.02040816326530612,0.0,0.0,1.536891356,18.76,22705.725,2,0.317998535,0.42659,2015-Jan-30,PCAR

Great That 's great color Quick follow up You talked about your rig contract roll off and the strategy there Can you talk about your completions contracts and the strategy for keeping them busy Do those contracts roll or are they longer term,6,43,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046511627906976744,0.0,0.850353858,18.76,21960.664,11,0.278990603,0.03367,2015-Jan-30,BXP
Thanks very much To follow up on that last question how are competitors responding to the weaker environment Have you seen any change in the pricing environment in both the production and the office side,3,35,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05714285714285714,0.850353858,18.76,21960.664,11,0.278990603,0.03367,2015-Jan-30,BXP
I guess my {CARDINAL} question will be can you help us understand what the basis for this midteens EPS growth and in particular what I 'm talking about is let 's just assume the number for {DATE} is {MONEY} You 've got {MONEY} at least of Roundup made goods in the channel that if I 'm correct do n't reoccur {DATE} you 've got this charge now for the skew rationalization in corn you 've got some SG&A savings coming in and then you 've got {DATE} production costs that is unclear how much if any of them are going to recur {DATE} given the change in strategy so can you help us understand and you also have a corn hedge Can you help us understand what the actual base is for this midteens growth,6,135,0,0.0,0.0,0.014814814814814815,0.0,0.014814814814814815,1.3782605769999998,18.76,15479.49936,6,0.690201631,3.367,2015-Jan-30,XRX
So just to be clear I know you I think you were very clear I just want to understand At this point you think you 're tracking below the high end of the range of the pipeline related costs otherwise known at the costs that shareholders are most likely going to have to bear so it 's less than the {MONEY} high end,3,63,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.3982056530000002,20.97,4819.7402,6,0.02888926,0.3873,2015-Feb-02,PBI
And then I guess my other question would be on a related note even though you did take a Long Term Care reserve charge on GAAP there was n't much of a statutory impact from it {DATE} So it really has had minimal impact on capital management which you 've been able to still do in a fairly robust way If there was a Long Term Care issue on claims incidence would that also be a stat issue And would that potentially change the outlook on capital management And then just a related question has there been a corresponding statutory impact now that you 've seen some softening on GAAP on Long Term Care {DATE},5,115,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.008695652173913044,0.034782608695652174,2.975259466,19.43,41054.776,9,0.257032578,2.41203,2015-Feb-03,LYB
Right As you continue to gain scale how do you think about your property management platform {DATE} from a profitability perspective Is it still just a future source for acquisitions and a source of incremental tenant insurance revenues Or is it a profitable business,4,44,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06818181818181818,0.0,2.975259466,19.43,41054.776,9,0.257032578,2.41203,2015-Feb-03,LYB
Good {TIME} Bill I just wanted to follow up on Nigel 's question about equity sensitivity first {PERCENT} or the {MONEY} impact from a {PERCENT} decline Does that contemplate any change in the net investment income yield in the {CARDINAL} of equity securities and other LP interest,4,47,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02127659574468085,0.0425531914893617,1.360760226,19.43,32433.774,11,0.494005452,0.14755,2015-Feb-03,AET
Okay And sort of following on that as you look at the level of housing starts where we are now your level of profitability in wood what sort of housing start level do you think you need to see generally speaking to see the wood business get back to levels of profitability or prices and volumes sort of normalize What kind of level of housing starts would you need to see,3,71,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.028169014084507043,0.0,1.355372454,19.43,6397.26776,11,0.28359174,0.73535,2015-Feb-03,CNC

I know that you 're very restricted on what you can say with respect to the strategic review that 's currently under way I was wondering if it 's fair to say that investors can assume that something will actually occur that there will actually be a transaction of some sort where you 'll be separating something or selling something and I was wondering also if you can frame it You had mentioned in your press release about how you 're looking at a scenario where you 'd like to maintain a strong credit profile how that would occur if you were to separate the business how the credit profile would actually be able to maintain a strong credit profile given that you 'd be separating a strong cash flow assets from some assets that are for example like E&P where sorry excuse me where you 're potentially running beyond your cash flow and so fourth so I was wondering if you could answer those questions,3,166,0,0.0,0.006024096385542169,0.012048192771084338,0.024096385542168676,0.006024096385542169,1.2114990490000002,17.33,15180.99566,6,0.185496871,1.28675,2015-Feb-04,MSI
Hi guys Just wanted to dig into the severance charges for {TIME} You mentioned that you are including those in your GAAP OpEx guidance What level would you expect that to be in {DATE},4,34,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.236618216,17.33,26848.09326,4,0.516148806,7.33098,2015-Feb-04,MPC
You 've mentioned the data from combination studies for Telaprevir and could be available by {DATE} I know you 're not prepared to talk about specifics of the trial design there but what kind of data are you talking about Is this RVR data and then secondly are regulators requiring any type of combination animal tox data prior to starting these studies and if so do you have that data,4,70,0,0.0,0.014285714285714285,0.014285714285714285,0.0,0.0,1.546515132,17.33,8290.5368,11,0.980708892,1.18406,2015-Feb-04,UNM
Just wanted to follow back on the RBS deal I 've got to assume that it would be in the best interest of everyone to under normal circumstances to have the deal go as quickly as possible as opposed to it taking {DATE} or so to get a picture on this Just because of the human factor Am I right about that or how much time should we think about a potential deal probably taking,4,75,0,0.013333333333333334,0.013333333333333334,0.04,0.013333333333333334,0.013333333333333334,1.546515132,17.33,8290.5368,11,0.980708892,1.18406,2015-Feb-04,UNM
Just looking at the difference in the growth rates between the C&I non accruals and net charge offs basically with non accruals up a lot and charge offs down and we know how timing can sometimes be skewed but I 'm wondering where is the average C&I non accrual now marked relative to par,3,54,0,0.0,0.018518518518518517,0.018518518518518517,0.0,0.0,0.842246018,17.33,7363.4956200000015,11,0.464991538,0.37463,2015-Feb-04,AJG
I 'm doing fine Talk about a couple of things First off commercial versus residential price increases are they roughly the same level are the timing of them different You have different end market dynamics in terms of demand happening there what are your thoughts there Jeff,4,47,0,0.0,0.0,0.02127659574468085,0.0,0.0,0.842246018,17.33,7363.4956200000015,11,0.464991538,0.37463,2015-Feb-04,AJG

On the I know you 're not updating the environmental CapEx at the merchant fleet because of the proposed EPA rules but is there any directional is there any major change that you think may be happening there as a result of that or is it pretty much is it pretty much useful for what we know right now,1,59,0,0.0,0.01694915254237288,0.01694915254237288,0.0,0.0,0.988187407,17.33,26625.18583,11,0.8397287859999999,0.19243,2015-Feb-04,AFL

Looks like I stumped him Well if you get the number maybe you get back to me off line On the next question just help me through incremental margins on the intermodal product As I have always understood it intermodal business that goes on existing trains tends to actually have pretty high incremental margins which is contrary to people 's historical belief on the intermodal product Is that still the case as we think about some of this new Maersk business that is going on existing CSX trains,5,88,0,0.011363636363636364,0.011363636363636364,0.011363636363636364,0.0,0.022727272727272728,0.885035773,17.33,13935.30138,5,0.021831549,3.76843,2015-Feb-04,CLX
Okay and then just one on the potential spinoff of the retail business {CARDINAL} of probably not a pure company but certainly a large fuel marketer has been trying to spin off purely fuel marketing business for {DATE} and has not yet done that Does that give you pause perhaps that the market might not be as receptive to this as it could have been,3,65,0,0.0,0.046153846153846156,0.06153846153846154,0.015384615384615385,0.0,1.18048861,18.33,23816.22832,8,0.753897404,0.79966,2015-Feb-05,PPL

I guess I was sort of looking at in context of what you spent in {DATE} vs {DATE} Looked to be a bit more and with revisions you say even without revisions looked to be about the same as {DATE} if there was any read through in that,2,48,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.171009431,18.33,48890.00088,9,0.240391275,5.27901,2015-Feb-05,MCK
Thanks I wonder if you can give us a little color Your nonfuel expense as mentioned was better than expected Looks like some of that was due to maybe some SG&A getting pushed into {DATE} Can you give us a sense of how much of that was expense not going to show up in {DATE} versus what will,5,58,0,0.0,0.017241379310344827,0.017241379310344827,0.017241379310344827,0.0,1.171009431,18.33,48890.00088,9,0.240391275,5.27901,2015-Feb-05,MCK
So basically in effect are borrowing to buy back stock when you do do that,1,15,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.985552504,18.33,8589.339,11,0.873703573,0.5743699999999999,2015-Feb-05,CINF
Right Sometimes sense is a casualty in some of these procedures So we 'll see how it works out I guess looking at your working capital on the cash flow statement you mentioned that part of that was I think the {MONEY} for the tax payments related to the Point Beach but the {DATE} difference is {MONEY} So I was curious what else is in there that is causing that difference,6,71,0,0.0,0.014084507042253521,0.014084507042253521,0.0,0.0,1.205491459,18.33,9057.3903,3,0.114116223,0.54198,2015-Feb-05,BLL
On the dividend on the increase {DATE} can you just remind us the thought process as far as what you guys are looking for from a long term policy perspective and thought process behind that ratio,1,36,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.205491459,18.33,9057.3903,3,0.114116223,0.54198,2015-Feb-05,BLL
Thank you Good {TIME} Let me add my congratulations If I could ask on gross margin you did n't talk about occupancy Could you give a sense on how occupancy expense was performed and gross margin and what your outlook is for the rest of {DATE},5,46,0,0.0,0.043478260869565216,0.043478260869565216,0.021739130434782608,0.0,2.320728206,18.33,11287.197,8,0.551915815,2.8064400000000003,2015-Feb-05,EQT
Okay And then the second question is you made some comments around natural gas pipeline growth potentially in the MidContinent Can you talk about what you 're seeing there in terms of where you see the long term opportunities from a growth perspective and would that do you think that 's mostly going to entail expansion of existing pipelines or do you think there 's actually room there for another pipeline and where would it go,3,76,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.013157894736842105,0.013157894736842105,2.320728206,18.33,11287.197,8,0.551915815,2.8064400000000003,2015-Feb-05,EQT
Peter if I could ask a quick follow up Could you elaborate on which component prices you expect to be up in {DATE},2,23,0,0.0,0.08695652173913043,0.08695652173913043,0.0,0.0,2.320728206,18.33,11287.197,8,0.551915815,2.8064400000000003,2015-Feb-05,EQT
Right great And then just one follow up question On your multi asset platform have you experienced any situations where the level of wins here have been a little slower than you expected Do BlackRock 's ownership or excuse me level of management of assets with the potential client,4,49,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02040816326530612,0.04081632653061224,1.2891049959999998,16.85,4438.6122,6,0.36003346,1.64432,2015-Feb-06,FLIR
Thanks Good {TIME} Guys I just wanted to ask you on the expense guidance {DATE} it had the {MONEY} reversal and it also included some of the {DATE} step up from the FICA tax as well So when you are talking about flat expenses can you talk about whether that is ex those items or inclusive of those items,5,59,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01694915254237288,0.0,1.277733871,16.85,6258.03465,11,0.191388048,5.30721,2015-Feb-06,AIV
So to be clear {CARDINAL} for the balance of the year or for {DATE} in total,1,16,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.813293031,18.55,8015.8932,12,0.6850634179999999,1.26907,2015-Feb-10,MLM
So does it make sense for us to not look for you to break out revenue synergies over time,1,19,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05263157894736842,0.976849022,18.55,36366.3898,1,0.14364945199999998,0.11989,2015-Feb-10,RAI^G17
And then seeing large companies now start splitting up to unlock value and you all have talked a lot about the sum of parts value how do you think about the benefits of being a larger company as you kind of aggregated the assets You 've been splitting up and selling parts How do you keep the whole thing together or do you think about a bigger benefit of splitting up to unlock value,3,74,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.013513513513513514,0.0,1.971390233,18.55,40229.8194,10,0.06049999,0.12283,2015-Feb-10,REGN
Thanks a lot Good {TIME} Marc so and probably this is for Pete too So if you roll up all the restructuring you have kind of done in {DATE} {CARDINAL} and then what you have discussed in {CARDINAL} and {CARDINAL} taking all of that rolling it up what kind of net benefit does that suggest to {DATE} in terms of operating profit,4,62,0,0.0,0.016129032258064516,0.03225806451612903,0.03225806451612903,0.016129032258064516,1.971390233,18.55,40229.8194,10,0.06049999,0.12283,2015-Feb-10,REGN
Okay And then a question just going back to USCIS We 've seen a big increase in mailing volumes it sounds like you 're thinking about a modest uptick in reporting volume How would you how do you relate the {CARDINAL} if we continue to see a return towards a peak level peak cycle mailing volumes what does that imply for organic revenue growth in USCIS,4,66,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.015151515151515152,1.1602317290000002,18.55,22908.85956,6,0.161099048,0.49224,2015-Feb-10,CERN
Great And just under the electric transmission margins Was there any contribution from any positive close outs in {DATE} that may have moved the margins a little bit higher It seems like the storm benefit was kind of offset with negatives and some of the other work that you were doing So it seems like storm was not necessarily the contributor but I was wondering if there was close outs And maybe now that utilization levels are moving higher are the margins in {DATE} indicative of some of the trends that you hoped to see in the busier {DATE},6,99,0,0.0,0.020202020202020204,0.04040404040404041,0.030303030303030304,0.010101010101010102,1.215300683,18.55,20042.23732,11,0.530331495,1.20225,2015-Feb-10,HCP
But Per have you seen anybody actually sign up for it for {DATE} or do you think that this is just a discussion that leads now into the {DATE} selling season,1,31,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.347099917,17.23,12130.55943,8,0.615986529,0.66557,2015-Feb-11,WEC
So just to be clear on the billings it sounds like if we add back the {MONEY} versus what you guided to you would have grown billings {PERCENT} in terms of your proxy So first of all is that the right math And secondly along that line it 's a little bit of a deceleration from what we 've seen in {DATE} Did {DATE} play out like you expected relative to what you saw in terms of demand Or was there anything that might have slowed down a little bit in {DATE},5,92,0,0.0,0.010869565217391304,0.010869565217391304,0.0,0.010869565217391304,1.347099917,17.23,12130.55943,8,0.615986529,0.66557,2015-Feb-11,WEC
Okay that is helpful Then Ted on the incremental margin discussion where are we on price cost at this point in {DATE} Are we fully seeing the {DATE} price increase number one sticking and number {CARDINAL} reflected in the incrementals at this point,3,43,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.153039723,17.23,19104.9075,9,0.27761509300000003,0.50845,2015-Feb-11,WFM
Good {TIME} and my congratulations as well With regard to your extra effort at marketing in {DATE} clearly it 's paid off But could you give us a little bit clearer idea of how the marketing was spent You mentioned concentration on digital And what can we look forward in {DATE} with respect to the marketing effort and the amount being employed,5,62,0,0.016129032258064516,0.016129032258064516,0.016129032258064516,0.016129032258064516,0.0,1.153039723,17.23,19104.9075,9,0.27761509300000003,0.50845,2015-Feb-11,WFM
Yes good morning John on slide {CARDINAL} of your deck in Fine Chemistry you indicate that demand for bromine derivatives remains high with certain products in sold out positions What products are sold out and why,3,36,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.027777777777777776,0.0,1.737125173,17.23,29832.18044,3,0.292897531,0.1518,2015-Feb-11,AMAT
Okay {CARDINAL} more if I look at your Specialty Property results in terms of catastrophe losses and you compare that to the normal homeowners insurance companies the frequency of cat losses is a lot higher with the All State State Farm 's of the world than it is with you guys I 'd assume you would have {DATE} with the catastrophe than those guys or cat losses given that you 've got more of an exposure to cat prone areas or your placement rates are higher there So do you have any comments on that on why you seem to have {DATE} where there are any cat losses,4,108,0,0.0,0.0,0.018518518518518517,0.0,0.06481481481481481,0.948347775,17.23,11834.51844,9,0.268120197,5.41585,2015-Feb-11,HSIC
Does that suggest that you sort of anticipate more stable margins as we think about {DATE},1,16,0,0.0,0.0625,0.125,0.0625,0.0,1.401793979,16.96,7571.8797,7,0.13902751,1.20236,2015-Feb-12,SNI
Okay Lastly I realize you have {DATE} in {DATE} and we will probably get an updated thought around operating margin for PSM at that point in time Looking at {DATE} if we assume you go back to the long term target that 's actually down operating margin for PSM Is there a mix issue in {DATE} that would cause operating margins to come down slightly from the {DATE} level,4,69,0,0.0,0.0,0.028985507246376812,0.0,0.0,1.401793979,16.96,7571.8797,7,0.13902751,1.20236,2015-Feb-12,SNI
Good {TIME} everybody Just wanted to try and understand the operating expense guidance that you gave by division and maybe more specifically I guess the SKU with the contribution of Amba how should we think about what the incremental expense contribution there would be on the MA side,2,48,0,0.0,0.020833333333333332,0.020833333333333332,0.020833333333333332,0.0,1.219204996,16.96,11853.49566,9,0.203090382,1.27505,2015-Feb-12,AAP

Okay good That 's helpful and I appreciate the color Then I guess just as a follow up I want to make sure I understand the loan growth dynamic correctly Because of the CAMCO transaction there 's a little bit more of a gap than is typical between your end of period and average balances And the accounting change you {DATE} does n't necessarily help I guess So it 's almost as simple as thinking the end of period which is I guess more of a double digit annualized growth rate is just a much better proxy for what we should be expecting for overall loan growth than the more modest annualized growth if you just did the average numbers,6,120,0,0.0,0.008333333333333333,0.008333333333333333,0.016666666666666666,0.0,0.87851159,16.96,16321.655,10,0.371110277,2.95919,2015-Feb-12,DVA
So is that {PERCENT} range growth in realized rents per square foot is that sustainable going through the year as even as you have discounts decreasing,1,26,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.87851159,16.96,16321.655,10,0.371110277,2.95919,2015-Feb-12,DVA
Thanks a lot guys Congratulations on {DATE} from me as well here Within the software defined data center space you 've clearly addressed the compute layer with both RHEL and RHEV and the storage layer with Gluster and now Inktank But I 'm curious could you make a bigger splash in the networking layer beyond partnerships with Cisco and say support of Nacira through OpenStack,4,65,0,0.015384615384615385,0.015384615384615385,0.015384615384615385,0.0,0.0,0.87851159,16.96,16321.655,10,0.371110277,2.95919,2015-Feb-12,DVA
Got it Thanks {CARDINAL} longer term question I have Can you just give us an overall sense on your long term view of the independent business as some of these business owners begin to retire Are you seeing them pass down their businesses within the family to selling to other independents or do you think ultimately this can become a pipeline for GPC Company owned stores down the road,5,69,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.014492753623188406,1.286314261,15.34,14865.47409,8,0.794415401,1.46396,2015-Feb-13,DTE

Hi guys I just wanted to follow up on the question around basically the invoicing trends and just to get a little bit more granular in terms of how you 're seeing customer relationships mature Is this a function in your eyes of bigger transaction sizes Do you see this because the product line 's broadening What are some of the puts and takes as you negotiate with the customer in terms of do you not want to discount for getting the cash up front How does that negotiation play out and how does it ultimately impact that calculated billings proxy without maybe using a better word of obsess on {DATE},6,111,0,0.0,0.009009009009009009,0.009009009009009009,0.009009009009009009,0.009009009009009009,1.175356283,15.34,25470.514,11,0.421699284,1.90522,2015-Feb-13,VTR
And any reason in terms of what you are doing that you think is driving it to be a little bit better or you think it is just a little better economy in those areas relative to the rest of the country,2,42,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047619047619047616,0.0,1.52851217,15.34,8849.72564,12,0.246235264,0.39473,2015-Feb-13,IPG
That 's helpful Thanks And if I could just ask a quick follow up that 's unrelated if we just do a quick back of the envelope math on your recent buyback it would seem at the pace you 've been repurchasing shares there was n't any real need for an increase of the authorization at this point So could we conclude that maybe given the strength of the balance sheet this is something you 're going to accelerate the pace of going forward or we should not necessarily come to that conclusion,4,93,0,0.0,0.03225806451612903,0.03225806451612903,0.010752688172043012,0.0,1.019209091,15.34,4666.3371,11,1.164564583,10.80074,2015-Feb-13,AIZ
Just building on what Jamie was talking about Marie could you just expand a little bit on your outlook for worldwide AG tonnage up {PERCENT} in {CARDINAL} versus revenues up {PERCENT} I know you 're saying that you have committment internally that you can meet this forecast but how much of the forecast is constrained by either your capacity constraints or supplier capacity constraints,2,64,0,0.0,0.015625,0.015625,0.0,0.0,1.537342038,14.69,13486.4653,6,0.293515328,0.14023,2015-Feb-17,A

Okay great Then if I just kind of look at the royalty business I think with Nan Ya projected to start kicking in some time {DATE} in terms of their production Just wondering how should we be modeling basically our thinking about that royalty and licensing revenue stream in {DATE} Do we expect R&D kind of sharing part of that revenue stream to start declining or does that start picking up because of the units coming out of sorry from Nan Ya in {DATE} What 's the directionality and what 's the magnitude of that industry in {DATE},6,98,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01020408163265306,0.01020408163265306,1.331339601,14.69,14828.65757,9,0.206758278,0.42175,2015-Feb-17,GPC

Makes sense And then my last question about Tandigm what is your enrollment target if we think about {DATE} down the road How many lives do you think you will have an arrangement,3,33,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.030303030303030304,1.518879799,13.12,8412.47123,11,0.28359174,1.2939,2015-Apr-28,CNC
Sorry The first part was just if you were to look at the Midwest and Northeast in {DATE} how did that performance or the year over year growth compare to {DATE} And then second part of it was any thoughts as to why it did n't accelerate more,3,48,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.518879799,13.12,8412.47123,11,0.28359174,1.2939,2015-Apr-28,CNC

Okay that 's helpful And obviously you guys made a conscious effort and decision here with your partner to reduce activity I 'm imagining that probably part of that was due to weak gas prices that we 're experiencing here Can you talk at all about what type of gas prices you and your partner think you guys would need to see before picking up activity again,4,67,0,0.0,0.0,0.014925373134328358,0.0,0.014925373134328358,1.28075691,13.12,8707.4759,11,0.341936618,3.16461,2015-Apr-28,UDR
And then on slide {CARDINAL} I noted that your maintenance and growth CapEx was down {DATE} And Scott talked about the focus on optimizing maintenance capital So is the you 've talked in the past the {MONEY} run rate on maintenance capital Is the new rate lower given your comments on how you are trying to optimize that level,4,59,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.35818919,12.41,63812.9625,10,0.40627606,0.29671,2015-Apr-29,ESRX
And then I appreciate that color so when you both mention this concept of stabilizing the business what do you mean Does that mean you are holding or gaining share in your businesses Does that mean you are growing faster than what you believe your addressable markets are in revenue terms Does that mean you 're growing in absolute terms How will investors know that you have stabilized the business and what is the timeframe that you think for getting there,5,81,0,0.0,0.0,0.012345679012345678,0.037037037037037035,0.0,1.059758231,12.41,44072.96032,3,0.260563818,5.23778,2015-Apr-29,GD
{CARDINAL} quick questions Roger {DATE} you talked about an environment here in the U.S. that you had never really seen before Has there been any changes in your view in {DATE} on that And are you seeing anything that 's making you either more comfortable or less comfortable about what we 're seeing here,4,54,0,0.018518518518518517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.018518518518518517,1.059758231,12.41,44072.96032,3,0.260563818,5.23778,2015-Apr-29,GD
Without asking to go too far into the future would you say this is going to be the most revenue challenged segment over the long term But of course you know we would see upside or offset I should say from Aerospace and elsewhere,2,44,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.022727272727272728,0.939569497,12.41,8661.6666,11,0.873703573,2.70158,2015-Apr-29,CINF
Okay If I could follow onto that question it 's in relation to industry volumes I wanted to ask first if did the whole category have to fewer shipping {DATE} in the {DATE} Therefore were underlying volumes down closer to {PERCENT} for the category Would that be a fair representation I wanted to get a sense of what you see that doing for {DATE} for {DATE},6,66,0,0.0,0.015151515151515152,0.015151515151515152,0.0,0.015151515151515152,1.060424642,12.41,24009.7473,12,0.311021717,0.33394,2015-Apr-29,WM

A quick question for Marty if I can Jack talked a little bit about how you might change your investment approach if there is a change in the dividend outlook for some of the financial companies And I 'm wondering whether you 're does that mean that you 're going to wait for an announcement or is there any proactive analysis you can do that would lead to a change in investment strategy,3,73,0,0.0,0.0136986301369863,0.0136986301369863,0.0136986301369863,0.0136986301369863,1.148065262,12.41,11510.97024,12,0.040890805,4.42014,2015-Apr-29,VRSK
Sure thank you I 'm sure you want to leave the denosumab commercialization questions for the meeting but I guess sort of as a prelude can you just talk about what factors we should be aware of we should think about when we think about the commercialization strategy of denosumab,3,50,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02,1.111688573,12.41,12629.2033,3,0.30374033100000003,0.67696,2015-Apr-29,AME
Just to go back is to your first comment so DSD you said mix of generics as well as larger independent customers is it fair to say though George you look at the generic program you said your sales were up {PERCENT} your {CARDINAL} competitors appear to be growing faster than that Is there a great opportunity for you to improve your margin here as you continue to penetrate generics into your book of business,2,75,0,0.0,0.0,0.013333333333333334,0.04,0.0,1.111688573,12.41,12629.2033,3,0.30374033100000003,0.67696,2015-Apr-29,AME

Hey guys a question for you on the Pioneer transmission line I have seen a little bit of news flow on that in terms of the FERC granting incentive ROEs but still got a long way to go I think in terms of the state and RTO process Can you just provide a regulatory update on what the kind of what the path is for getting that line approved,4,69,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.014492753623188406,2.61395396,12.41,10523.0307,4,0.494268352,1.06329,2015-Apr-29,RRC
Okay And then in terms of the growth in Ross now are you in terms of the store size given you have taken down inventory so much have you come up with a new prototype size for the store given how much less inventory is going into new stores,3,49,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.61395396,12.41,10523.0307,4,0.494268352,1.06329,2015-Apr-29,RRC
{CARDINAL} related questions then So what I believe the conclusion would be is that we should see accelerating sales growth in {DATE} and in {DATE} as that depleted inventory gets refilled so number {CARDINAL} comment on that and then second can you give us any kind of quantification as to a Slim Jim impact for {DATE},3,56,0,0.0,0.0,0.017857142857142856,0.0,0.03571428571428571,0.832150332,12.41,35438.667480000004,5,0.182006009,0.18808,2015-Apr-29,PX

Hey guys I just wanted to ask about the {MONEY} in increased strategic marketing right I guess a lot of the media probably has n't yet started for many of your innovations If that 's right where is the incremental {MONEY} going Especially since Huggies seems like it had a pullback Could you give a little more detail on that,4,60,0,0.0,0.016666666666666666,0.05,0.016666666666666666,0.0,1.124808083,13.39,6654.79188,3,0.329243082,1.28634,2015-Apr-30,XYL
Okay Great You also mentioned that you had a number of other ones in negotiations Just as we kind of think about what your objectives are for {DATE} And I recognize M A can go in any direction or take longer or deals do n't happen at all But what should we be thinking of numbers for all and what should we be thinking of numbers for {DATE} and what sort of aggregate amount should we be thinking about you guys spending,6,82,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.012195121951219513,0.0,1.291111308,13.39,7576.02037,11,0.255415873,3.48567,2015-Apr-30,EXR
Thank you My first question is really just around your {DATE} guidance levels It obviously raised {CARDINAL} quite a bit Directionally should we be thinking about there is upside to any of these numbers or are you sticking with where you came out at analyst day,4,46,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.021739130434782608,2.588091761,13.39,11046.99012,7,0.206263547,0.8833700000000001,2015-Apr-30,EXPE
Hi guys Congrats on a great quarter and a good update Real quick {CARDINAL} questions {CARDINAL} can you walk us through of the rate increases that you received in both Missouri and Illinois how much you 've already taken and what 's left to be taken in {DATE},4,48,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041666666666666664,0.020833333333333332,1.531460297,13.39,15354.9304,11,0.408341249,1.233,2015-Apr-30,HST
Good {TIME} {CARDINAL} quick follow ups First on Canada what was driving the somewhat higher {DATE} estimate of the operating start up cost there and in general how are you progressing with hiring So that 's the first question And then second on credit looks like the net write off ratio of {CARDINAL} is approaching some of the lowest charge off ratios that that business has really ever experienced With the better credit quality of the REDcard holders where would you expect that to be bottoming out,5,87,0,0.011494252873563218,0.011494252873563218,0.011494252873563218,0.034482758620689655,0.011494252873563218,1.531460297,13.39,15354.9304,11,0.408341249,1.233,2015-Apr-30,HST

I 'm asking about the bloodbath on the servicing fee side And this is not a new question it just keeps getting worse and worse If I look at your servicing fees including foreign exchange and securities lending this is the lowest percentage of those fees to assets under custody in your history And you 're also seeing that at the other processing banks too We always ask this question what are you doing what can you do to stem the margin pressure in the core servicing business,5,88,0,0.022727272727272728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045454545454545456,1.226426335,13.39,32749.18692,11,0.403791409,3.2781,2015-Apr-30,CI

Hi can you hear me First off on your backlog communication is it right to think that your current level of backlog is about twice what you would normally carry or is it some different multiple of that,2,38,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.378654299,13.39,17466.6022,8,0.8885406109999999,0.98241,2015-Apr-30,XEL
Great And then from a utilization perspective I mean with what you 've booked now already and what you have in backlog on the mainline stuff for {DATE} all else equal in that business is it enough now to get you into that {PERCENT} margin range,2,46,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.021739130434782608,0.0,1.378654299,13.39,17466.6022,8,0.8885406109999999,0.98241,2015-Apr-30,XEL
Great good {TIME} {CARDINAL} questions {CARDINAL} on the pipeline and {CARDINAL} on the guidance for On the guidance for the range contemplates a series of potential outcomes there Dan I thought you said in the past that given the momentum in the business and the product launches you do expect to exit the year approaching mid to single digit organic revenue growth I just wanted to make sure that that still holds Or is there a change in your views from the last time we spoke,6,86,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.023255813953488372,0.011627906976744186,1.37473462,13.39,39301.9348,8,0.401814944,0.41727,2015-Apr-30,WMB
Thanks for taking my question and congrats on {DATE} another big picture R&D question maybe for George The guidance is calling for {PERCENT} or so year on year growth in that line I think when you joined the Company a few years ago you suggested you were going to bring down R&D to {PERCENT} of sales long term I guess the question is what convinces you you 're going to get a good return on the incremental R&D spend Obviously you can afford it but is it a good investment or not Were you still targeting more like a {PERCENT} of revenue long term target,8,105,0,0.0,0.009523809523809525,0.01904761904761905,0.01904761904761905,0.02857142857142857,2.027330385,13.39,8754.19673,4,1.089218941,1.12932,2015-Apr-30,MUR
So the confidence is more in internal things that you can control within the company as opposed to maybe a brighter view on your customers or global macro or anything like that,1,32,0,0.0,0.03125,0.03125,0.0,0.03125,2.027330385,13.39,8754.19673,4,1.089218941,1.12932,2015-Apr-30,MUR
That 's helpful On the gross margin for {DATE} it sounded like Knights Apparel was a little bit of pressure whereas DBA probably helped Maybe if you could just parcel that out a bit between those two and then,3,39,0,0.0,0.05128205128205128,0.07692307692307693,0.0,0.0,1.654184085,13.39,27989.25458,4,0.516148806,1.32776,2015-Apr-30,MPC

So how do you see this playing out If some of your competition out there is retrenching pulling back on spending and just trying to preserve capital and protect their balance sheet while you guys kind of have the balance sheet to probably be a little more proactive in this environment as retail bankruptcies emerge do you see risk kind of out there in the marketplace in terms of a lot of dislocation where you guys can come in and take market share,2,83,0,0.0,0.0,0.024096385542168676,0.012048192771084338,0.012048192771084338,1.619676226,14.55,21034.27748,8,0.930360893,1.28601,2015-May-01,PEG

Hi thanks A question for Richard and then maybe a follow up for Howard On the Comcast NBC Universal call Steve Burke said about the HBO OTT product he said I think it is going to be challenging for HBO to go and try and attract new customers into this ecosystem without cannibalizing existing customers I think you 've been clear Richard that you do n't think that will happen Presumably you will be working with your traditional MVPD partners I guess the question is if you have enough success with your partners on Internet plus type offerings as you 've described would you revisit your decision to roll out a standalone OTT product after that sequencing,6,117,0,0.0,0.008547008547008548,0.017094017094017096,0.008547008547008548,0.02564102564102564,1.29657921,14.55,6777.6552,8,0.943815292,1.36339,2015-May-01,PNW

Okay Thank you And then the second question I know {DATE} you guys talked about or you 've been reiterating {PERCENT} of revenue for CapEx spend Now you 're saying {CARDINAL} to {CARDINAL} Can you tell us how much of a reduction that looks to be And I guess on top of what looks to be {CARDINAL} pushout in the spending related to the wafer upgrade,6,66,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.015151515151515152,1.000709334,12.12,9315.5656,11,0.696054988,3.84863,2015-Jul-23,HBAN
It is just the rate Okay And just finally I think that there is some movement to try to change the RPS standard to allow hydro power from Manitoba to potentially count If that were to happen could you talk about maybe how what the investment opportunities would be for you there,4,52,0,0.0,0.038461538461538464,0.038461538461538464,0.019230769230769232,0.0,1.129770951,12.12,7620.98792,12,0.127601637,0.64688,2015-Jul-23,RHI

Okay And then just {CARDINAL} quick follow up John you mentioned in the prepared remarks that Rite Aid operational transition was completed Should we assume that the contribution from Rite Aid in {DATE} is now its full run rate And also around like along those lines you announced that you 've extended your contract with CVS from {DATE} Should we assume that that was also in your updated guidance Assuming that there 's a step down in pricing as you normally see with product renewals and extensions or is this something that we should factor in,7,96,0,0.0,0.0,0.03125,0.0,0.0,0.903784951,12.64,11693.90229,3,0.179199544,1.32672,2015-Jul-24,COL
Great And then just {CARDINAL} questions about the international market {CARDINAL} with what happened in Mexico with Comex has your existing business down there suffered at all from any of the maturations that happened did around that number one And then {CARDINAL} just with where currencies have gone would purchasing foreign assets be more attractive {DATE} than maybe it was {DATE} it was for you guys,5,66,0,0.0,0.015151515151515152,0.015151515151515152,0.030303030303030304,0.030303030303030304,0.903784951,12.64,11693.90229,3,0.179199544,1.32672,2015-Jul-24,COL

Hi good {TIME} everyone Ed the recovery of group has obviously been a common theme out there over {DATE} and just wanted to get your thoughts on some of the deeper trends here When you look at your future bookings are you seeing group strength spread outside of the top gateway markets into more resort locations or areas like Arizona and Hawaii And if so do you see any difference in outside the room spend between these locations and maybe some of the top gateway markets,4,86,0,0.0,0.011627906976744186,0.011627906976744186,0.023255813953488372,0.0,1.02171938,12.64,13659.5661,8,0.794415401,1.13247,2015-Jul-24,DTE
Thanks for the update on your synergy targets I just wondered if you could put a little meat on the bones that you have your {PERCENT} CASM of fuel guidance out there now So wondering specifically if you could quantify the cost synergies that are already baked into that as opposed to what you think is yet to come through in {DATE} and beyond as you cut over to a single reservation system and generally target the legacy cost structure,3,80,0,0.0,0.025,0.025,0.0,0.025,1.02171938,12.64,13659.5661,8,0.794415401,1.13247,2015-Jul-24,DTE
First the question on the acquisition for loss on Mike 's question Basically what underlying growth rate I believe is not in organic growth at these {CARDINAL} large acquisitions that you recently acquired,2,33,0,0.0,0.0,0.030303030303030304,0.0,0.09090909090909091,1.117627476,13.74,25290.27304,12,0.6282153229999999,0.10922,2015-Jul-27,NSC
Thank you very much for taking my question I wanted to focus on the consumer business Even with consumer revenues down {PERCENT} you were able to maintain {PERCENT} operating margin {CARDINAL} points better than {DATE} which is again very impressive and similar to {DATE} {DATE} of those {CARDINAL} points came from a year on year improvement to the OEM fees that were not paid as they were in {DATE} I 'm assuming that is similar in {DATE} but what I 'm trying to understand is for every dollar you save in OEM fees in the period you forgo multiple quarters of revenue for the unit you did n't acquire What I guess I 'm trying to ask is how sustainable should we think about the margin improvement being,6,128,0,0.0,0.0,0.0078125,0.0390625,0.0078125,1.060066284,15.6,10739.33991,6,0.204075512,3.80793,2015-Jul-28,WAT
Sure And just to make sure I understood your tour Ron my takeaway is that you expect sort of comparable organic growth rates from all {CARDINAL} of the non tech segments perhaps somewhat slower in tech but improved from {CARDINAL},2,40,0,0.0,0.05,0.05,0.025,0.025,1.10127867,15.6,8663.9696,11,0.341936618,7.161789999999999,2015-Jul-28,UDR
Thank you I have a couple of questions On the spinoff of cable which is arguably your fastest growing business it seems to be driven relatively by balance sheet differences So could you comment on what your comfort level is for leverage for the content businesses once they are separated Also you did n't fully comment on long term interest in retaining publishing And then on the CW writedown the {MONEY} writedown why I guess the question is why take a loss now And what do you expect from this asset over the long term,7,95,0,0.0,0.010526315789473684,0.021052631578947368,0.0,0.05263157894736842,1.10127867,15.6,8663.9696,11,0.341936618,7.161789999999999,2015-Jul-28,UDR

Okay So if historically you were growing I was referring to gross margin versus our number which is what I 'm more focused on of course In terms of the ratio I think it 's a {CARDINAL} {CARDINAL} type of rain ratio so you grow the bottom line {CARDINAL} and a half times faster than the top Is that the ratio I should be thinking about,4,66,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8734626329999999,15.6,7719.07068,11,0.677848142,2.22097,2015-Jul-28,TMK
John when you think about the model and obviously you guys have been transitioning fairly well especially relative to most other companies in general not just transport companies with net revenues being down and EPS remaining up the cost side has been a nice lever for you guys to be able to pull I guess {CARDINAL} pieces to the question Is this probably the worst that we see I mean do you think that with margins crunching you 're going to be able to offset that as maybe some volume comes back and gradually as long as we do n't see a major spike in the economy and then how fast do you need to bring people back onto deal with any of that volume that comes on alongside of any kind of re emergence of seasonality that we see,3,140,0,0.0,0.007142857142857143,0.014285714285714285,0.014285714285714285,0.014285714285714285,0.8734626329999999,15.6,7719.07068,11,0.677848142,2.22097,2015-Jul-28,TMK

Hi good {TIME} to you Question just going back to the difference between the performance of A 's and B 's And Terry you made reference to obviously AIMCO and compared the company to some of your peers But I 'm just curious as you are continuing to see the cap rates widen out between A 's and B 's do you feel that the expectations for rent growth from the more class A assets are just getting too high at this point in terms of growth over {DATE},4,89,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.011235955056179775,0.011235955056179775,0.8734626329999999,15.6,7719.07068,11,0.677848142,2.22097,2015-Jul-28,TMK

I 'd like to just ask a couple of questions on the middleware business Number one Charlie I do n't know if you can provide us with the number of top {CARDINAL} deals that were middleware only and then secondly if you could comment about just the general or subjective I should say qualitative growth rate of the middleware business versus the core business of billings growth in {DATE},2,69,0,0.0,0.014492753623188406,0.014492753623188406,0.0,0.014492753623188406,0.958856234,15.6,22944.285,2,0.317998535,3.68721,2015-Jul-28,PCAR

Okay that 's great And then in terms of pricing on e cigarettes typically even though it 's a little bit of apples and oranges with the refills versus a pack of cigarettes in terms of how the costs compare a consumer typically could reasonably expect to spend less on e cigarettes if they switch from cigarettes Do you think you could ever get that pricing at parity with cigarettes And if so how,4,74,0,0.0,0.02702702702702703,0.02702702702702703,0.013513513513513514,0.0,1.233477747,15.6,9803.5525,12,0.6838093340000001,7.098330000000002,2015-Jul-28,DHI

My first question is on the CapEx opportunities at the utilities above what 's in your current plan If you pull the Houston Import Project out of that bucket could you just comment on where you stand with respect to those upside opportunities And has there been any movement on specific projects and/or new projects pulled into that upside opportunity,3,60,0,0.0,0.016666666666666666,0.016666666666666666,0.05,0.016666666666666666,1.59112076,13.44,17880.2,6,0.511127374,0.67323,2015-Jul-29,WDC

Yes that sounds great Sounds like it 's pretty much strong across the board I guess if I could ask another question related to what you 're seeing in renovation particularly residential larger ticket remodel You indicated that you were seeing some continued strength or continued signs of improvement in that market Is there anything in particular that you would point to within the numbers Obviously if you look at the sales growth it would seem to suggest things are picking up But is there anything in particular swimming beneath the numbers that you would call out that gives you some hopeful sign or indicates a hopeful sign that we 're starting to see an improvement in larger ticket residential remodel,7,121,0,0.0,0.01652892561983471,0.01652892561983471,0.04132231404958678,0.008264462809917356,1.101155415,13.44,20089.25992,6,0.235192834,1.0406799999999998,2015-Jul-29,FISV
Hi guys thanks for taking my questions I have {CARDINAL} The first one {CARDINAL} units out of your forecast seems too big to me to be strictly a {CARDINAL} G in China situation so can you give us some feeling for I suspect this is beyond {CARDINAL} G this is {CARDINAL} G as well So do you actually have {CARDINAL} G licensees that were paying who are now under reporting and is this leaking out Secondly on the NDRC I know in your Q you talked about there would be likely a probable impact but your financial impact but you 're unable to size at this point Can you talk about what some of the possibilities are anywhere from fine to business model transitions Is there a possibility there could be an adverse change to your business in China and if there is how do you stop that adverse change from leaking out of China into the rest of your regions and impacting your royalty business overall,8,167,0,0.0,0.005988023952095809,0.029940119760479042,0.0,0.029940119760479042,1.101155415,13.44,20089.25992,6,0.235192834,1.0406799999999998,2015-Jul-29,FISV

And then in terms of the thought process on the go forward A we are kind of levered to the direction of spreads not as levered given the move of some things into held for mature but we are still levered toward incremental widening of spreads so is there any thought process around besides constantly monitoring the public markets another TARP injection a strategic buyer anything along that lines,1,69,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.124041863,12.5,8679.8731,11,0.255415873,1.19261,2015-Jul-30,EXR

I want to come back to distribution again because you have now got another publicly traded peer out there with a distribution business They have made {MONEY} in {DATE} You have lost {MONEY} I mean how much of this you think is maybe just a different treatment from an inventory standpoint And what are the other issues here because it is a huge delta,5,64,0,0.0,0.015625,0.015625,0.0,0.015625,1.100908103,12.5,9345.59572,11,0.980708892,0.57527,2015-Jul-30,UNM
Let me just follow up on John 's question there on the consumable side of the dental business Steve wondering if you could give any color on maybe price versus volume mix in the quarter and how you 're thinking about volume trends especially into {DATE} you lose {CARDINAL} to {CARDINAL} basis points of pricing tailwind into {DATE} So do you think volume growth can kind of back fill that and keep you in {PERCENT} range on the consumable side,3,80,0,0.0,0.025,0.025,0.0,0.025,1.4631060969999998,12.5,33589.330839999995,4,1.071734379,2.28281,2015-Jul-30,VLO
Paal can I follow up on the comment that you made about the new technology on the fracturing side You commented that the lesson of {CARDINAL} things one just fracture stage effectiveness and {CARDINAL} in propagation But the technology platform that is looking to be rolled out {DATE} looks to be more than just fluids involving hardware et cetera Can you expand upon that,4,64,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.988087519,12.5,17098.209219999993,8,0.8885406109999999,0.22902,2015-Jul-30,XEL

Real quick question both for Mitchell and I guess Steve You continue to talk about the Street not giving you credit for the vacancy Crystal City Skyline So {CARDINAL} questions {CARDINAL} is if you are buying vacancy in Crystal City what would you pay for that on a per square foot basis if you were a buyer And then second is there any economics for you at all in Skyline or is that all been essentially taken by the lenders,5,80,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.025,1.002180179,12.5,7696.08045,8,0.7983450670000001,0.7146899999999999,2015-Jul-30,SCG

Hi good {TIME} {TIME} I guess The first question I had was the {CARDINAL} things that supposed changed from the MA {DATE} was just the slightly more negative European outlook And then recently we had those risk retention rules signed on the structured side I was wondering if you guys had a view on those risk retention rules and how that might impact the structured business especially in the US,4,70,0,0.0,0.014285714285714285,0.04285714285714286,0.014285714285714285,0.02857142857142857,0.876340476,12.13,347073.7751,4,0.550048026,1.23117,2015-Jul-31,XOM
A couple of questions on the Rural Cellular transaction if you do n't mind Ivan I think you said in your comments that they wanted to get the transaction wrapped up by {DATE} Is there anything specific of why that had to be done Secondly how was the transaction going to be structured in relation to how it impacts the Vodafone relationship Will this be all cash out of Verizon Wireless and it does not change that And then third Doreen on the synergies that you outlined {MONEY} can you break those synergies down between the roaming synergies and the actual operating call synergies that might come out of that,6,110,0,0.0,0.00909090909090909,0.00909090909090909,0.0,0.01818181818181818,1.609087252,12.13,12983.34336,10,0.3658471720000001,4.50347,2015-Jul-31,UHS
Maybe for Jon If you guys hit the midpoint of your revenue guidance for {DATE} what do you anticipate inventories will do on {CARDINAL} basis,2,25,0,0.0,0.04,0.08,0.0,0.0,1.024344029,12.13,15770.5127,12,0.256064643,2.4462900000000003,2015-Jul-31,WY
Okay And then as far as the forward looking can you just talk about how much changes of changes in kind of the LIBOR rate would benefit that test and also how you expect the CPFF to work as far as when it starts on {DATE} and any expectation of how quickly the market could start to improve,2,58,0,0.0,0.017241379310344827,0.017241379310344827,0.034482758620689655,0.0,0.942711475,12.13,9649.59395,8,0.956113668,1.02539,2015-Jul-31,AEE
First question I missed the very beginning of your comments so I apologize if you said something about this but what are you guys seeing in the biz jet after market specifically Some utilization numbers started to pick up towards {DATE} Are you seeing that in any of the order rates and are you seeing any pickup at all in discretionary,4,61,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03278688524590164,1.127182408,12.13,6160.47876,11,0.191388048,6.46526,2015-Jul-31,AIV
Thanks very much My question has to do with the new operating segments particularly outside the United States {CARDINAL} items Can you talk about what the cost savings opportunities you are discovering are It looks like G&A and many of those segments are lower but maybe you are just picking it up in the corporate Or are you actually finding real opportunities to consolidate some of those into the new structure From an operating standpoint given your first quarter of operating under these different segments are there are examples of where you are operating the restaurants differently because different leadership is looking at these markets differently or is that too early to really say,8,114,0,0.0,0.008771929824561403,0.008771929824561403,0.02631578947368421,0.008771929824561403,2.686199722,12.12,5513.93704,8,0.986557298,0.33334,2015-Aug-03,FTR
Okay And just a little bit of color on your acquisition focus Paul I suspect it 's predominantly international but any sort of domestic focus order of magnitude whether you do a large deal small deal Is it all merchant acquiring or just a little bit more granular are in sort of how you 're thinking in terms of your priorities from a strategic perspective,5,65,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.015384615384615385,0.957475897,12.12,21252.48367,8,0.753897404,1.59387,2015-Aug-03,PPL
Earl it seemed to be thematic throughout the call that you 've talked about trying to capitalize on some of the stimulus money that 's out there can you maybe shed a little bit of light across the {CARDINAL} division on how you might do that,2,46,0,0.0,0.043478260869565216,0.043478260869565216,0.0,0.0,0.938616857,12.12,46721.8448,8,0.619647215,1.27502,2015-Aug-03,NEE
That 's very helpful If I could just ask {CARDINAL} more it would be about the breadth of foundry orders Is it one is it broader both in terms of the {DATE} and then {DATE} and potentially beyond,3,38,0,0.0,0.02631578947368421,0.02631578947368421,0.0,0.0,1.810655735,12.12,15118.84881,4,0.7423663770000001,3.05264,2015-Aug-03,NBL

Okay And then just as it relates to the Pipelines typically {DATE} have been the bidding season for the large diameter stuff You mentioned in your press release here that you 're expecting a couple large projects come forward With {DATE} off still do you think that the seasonality of those Pipeline bookings could maybe change {DATE} and come earlier than it normally has in the past,4,67,0,0.0,0.029850746268656716,0.029850746268656716,0.0,0.0,1.986063959,14.98,9029.59515,2,0.364797838,3.39645,2015-Oct-20,DOV
So if it is separate from opportunity for M&A what is the key variable I think you were {MONEY} or so buybacks {DATE} and you 're {MONEY} {DATE} What was it that changed that drove this step up in buybacks,3,40,0,0.0,0.0,0.025,0.025,0.0,1.869634696,14.98,15129.249780000002,11,0.851401793,3.4721,2015-Oct-20,FITB

Hi Steve Hi Ernie You referenced how a {MONEY} pushout in {DATE} would come back and benefit {DATE} I know it 's really still too early but just brought to mind how much of a hand to mouth situation are we in How much of a situation are we in {DATE} in terms of hand and mouth Because you do n't provide orders or order backlog I 'm just wondering in terms of the {MONEY} shipment guidance for {DATE} how much of that is pulling out of backlog and how much of it is instantaneous hand to mouth in order turns,7,101,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.009900990099009901,0.0,1.67300776,15.75,19260.0882,10,0.238124617,0.06036,2015-Oct-21,STJ^A17
Okay thank you For Mike on the Trident III that benefited from the additional investment income is there any way to think about how much more could flow through in {DATE} so we can calibrate models,2,36,0,0.0,0.027777777777777776,0.027777777777777776,0.027777777777777776,0.0,1.619537339,15.75,51253.52656000001,6,0.477904421,0.44972,2015-Oct-21,TMO
I had a couple questions First you talked a little bit about the increase in customer connections and I was wondering how that compared to say pre recession levels and also is there do you have any sense of whether any of that was pulled forward because of the good weather in {DATE} as far as household formation and that kind of thing,2,63,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.015873015873015872,0.031746031746031744,1.839749164,15.75,16085.9754,11,0.512404096,0.00254,2015-Oct-21,NTRS
Okay And sort of another big picture question sort of curious in the institutional channel a number of your peers have talked pretty strongly about the pipeline into {DATE} despite the market volatility So sort of curious of where that pipeline stands {DATE} maybe where it was at {DATE} and then within that could you talk a little about what you 're seeing in terms of asset allocation,3,68,0,0.014705882352941176,0.029411764705882353,0.04411764705882353,0.014705882352941176,0.029411764705882353,1.867811605,15.75,62211.00734,10,0.329730854,0.7991,2015-Oct-21,ABT
And then last thing I was wondering about is you talked a little bit about your nuclear construction plans Are you ready Have you laid out yet when you would hope to start construction or is it too early for that or at what point would you be ready to start actually on site work,4,55,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.319163548,15.75,11928.93,6,0.212757994,18.08041,2015-Oct-21,CTXS
Just a quick follow up when we look at the reserve right now I know you said you feel like we are in a recession Is that based on a recession scenario in terms of the level of reserves you have {CARDINAL} some of your consumer portfolios,3,47,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0425531914893617,2.319163548,15.75,11928.93,6,0.212757994,18.08041,2015-Oct-21,CTXS
And can you just talk about the core Neptune projects Have you seen municipalities cease installation and upgrades in {DATE} to {QUANTITY} business Then separately you talked about the small and mid size projects on the AMR side of the business that were being deployed Were there stalls put in place during and what have you seen thus far in {DATE},4,61,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01639344262295082,1.42568152,16.7,60912.45056000001,6,0.387275505,0.71828,2015-Oct-22,DHR
So with those delinquencies improving but the outlook for charge offs to be up another {CARDINAL} basis points {DATE} it seems that bankruptcy is a becoming a bigger percentage of the charge off,1,33,0,0.0,0.0,0.030303030303030304,0.030303030303030304,0.06060606060606061,1.968881444,16.7,81051.10972000001,12,0.340845408,2.35985,2015-Oct-22,UNP
Okay thanks and my follow up On the market technology business I guess I 've always thought of that business as {DATE} stronger in the second and Fourth Quarters and the results {DATE} results were quite stable so not to get too near term focused but is that {CARDINAL} stability primarily driven by the installation of the {CARDINAL} wins you spoke about and are they at full run rate,2,69,0,0.014492753623188406,0.0,0.0,0.043478260869565216,0.0,1.522961491,16.7,12648.71322,12,0.209107554,8.61611,2015-Oct-22,SRCL
So just a question on the outlook for sales growth in the Commercial Foods segment I know you 've given us guidance on operating profit in {DATE} but there was a lot of volatility in the pricing growth and the volume growth {DATE} It really flicks around between {DATE} {CARDINAL} As we look out into {DATE} are we likely to see I guess a slowdown in the volume growth over {DATE} but maybe a moderation in the price declines Is that the right way to think about it,4,88,0,0.0,0.011363636363636364,0.022727272727272728,0.0,0.045454545454545456,2.169451244,16.7,6861.7655,12,0.6060288070000001,4.83689,2015-Oct-22,PHM
Okay I noticed where you gave your shipment figures and then you had your retail share figures {CARDINAL} that stood out in my opinion was Camel where you had shipments flat but your market share for Camel was down a little bit at retail I was just curious in relation to that because Pall Mall showed a relatively similar shipment pattern but had a much stronger retail share pattern Can you talk about those {CARDINAL} maybe what was going on with those Was that really just the distortions in shipments because of inventory,6,93,0,0.0,0.010752688172043012,0.010752688172043012,0.010752688172043012,0.010752688172043012,1.329799206,16.7,93599.30215,10,0.126957805,1.31181,2015-Oct-22,MMM
Hi good {TIME} everyone My question was based on the information on your lease activity page if I sort of back into what I think the non suite to suite spreads would be versus the suite to suite spreads on new leases that were signed after {DATE} it looks like they were around down {PERCENT} Could you just give us any more clarity into what 's causing that negative spread {DATE} which is causing a drag on sort of your leasing spreads overall,3,83,0,0.0,0.012048192771084338,0.012048192771084338,0.012048192771084338,0.03614457831325301,1.329799206,16.7,93599.30215,10,0.126957805,1.31181,2015-Oct-22,MMM
And then on price competitiveness are you seeing a different level of price competitiveness from some of the bigger banks or is it pretty much just very competitive out west across the board,1,33,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.038204334,16.7,13576.7057,12,1.017055717,1.2423,2015-Oct-22,FCX
Right okay I 've got a question about the fuel hedging So when I look at the schedule and the release and out through {CARDINAL} and {CARDINAL} you 're kind of holding in the {CARDINAL} floor range and you are keeping the upper range {CARDINAL} {CARDINAL} How do you think about migrating the ban Are you going to march the ban down or are you going to kind of consistently stay in the {CARDINAL} to {CARDINAL} range,6,77,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.012987012987012988,2.576476192,16.7,7635.378409999998,11,0.766071472,3.34135,2015-Oct-22,ETFC
Yes now that you have closed the Indura acquisition can you comment a little bit about the earnings accretion you might enjoy for {DATE},1,24,0,0.0,0.041666666666666664,0.041666666666666664,0.041666666666666664,0.041666666666666664,2.15114078,16.7,11320.56912,8,0.551915815,0.6690699999999999,2015-Oct-22,EQT
And just on Greater Gabbard you mentioned that you 're hopeful for a swift resolution there Is that an indication that you actually are seeing real progress Or is that really just what you 're hoping for right now,3,39,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05128205128205128,0.0,2.15114078,16.7,11320.56912,8,0.551915815,0.6690699999999999,2015-Oct-22,EQT
First question before the {PERCENT} long term EPS growth rate what time period roughly should we thinking about that Is that a {DATE} growth rate {DATE} What associated rate based growth should we assume is imbedded in that growth rate target,4,41,0,0.0,0.0,0.04878048780487805,0.0,0.024390243902439025,1.323626405,16.7,96573.1974,9,0.160466653,3.84805,2015-Oct-22,MCD
So with that in mind you made some comment about keeping dry powder essentially for bolt on acquisitions Does this take out the possibility of repurchasing your own stock at some point in time in {DATE},2,36,0,0.0,0.0,0.027777777777777776,0.0,0.0,1.704841874,16.7,8460.51858,11,0.696054988,1.46248,2015-Oct-22,HBAN
Okay And then just a quick follow up on with engine margins I know you have some dilution from Wahler here but the margins have been down and I know you talked core being up But any color around what you 're seeing on the core business going forward Do you still expect to see increases in the core business And I realize here in the back {CARDINAL} you 're still going to have some dilution from Wahler but if we think about it once that 's fully integrated how should we think about margin trajectory within engine,8,98,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.704841874,16.7,8460.51858,11,0.696054988,1.46248,2015-Oct-22,HBAN
Got it As then just as a follow up looks like there 's a lot of activity going on on the foundry side Besides the FinFet related yield issues have you guys seen any pick up on incremental size say for {CARDINAL} Or are you just focused mostly on {DATE} {DATE} {DATE} at this point,4,55,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.40610028,14.45,44029.84625,9,0.257032578,1.83001,2015-Oct-23,LYB
Okay And as a follow up I just wanted to talk a little more about colo versus wholesale And I do n't want to steal the thunder from your {DATE} {DATE} But it smells a little like Bill you 're thinking about making a significant strategic shift here in moving the Company away from being a more traditional plain vanilla wholesale player into a data center company that 's a little more I 'll call it vertically diversified if you will Am I going too far that it smells like this is a pretty big strategic change you 're thinking about,5,101,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.565332231,14.45,28988.69274,12,0.054029366,1.30634,2015-Oct-23,AAL
Okay Great Just as a follow up I know you are trying to take inventory levels up If you could remind us where you are looking to take them How long do you think it is going to take to get there Is there a leverage benefit on margins as you do that,6,53,0,0.0,0.018867924528301886,0.018867924528301886,0.03773584905660377,0.0,1.467600869,14.46,28933.59654,11,0.395835992,2.04537,2015-Oct-26,EQR
Okay Great because my follow up to that was just going to be if you had any update to cash flow targets I think we are waiting for updates to {DATE} target I was curious if you had any thoughts on that yet,4,43,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.023255813953488372,0.0,1.467600869,14.46,28933.59654,11,0.395835992,2.04537,2015-Oct-26,EQR
Okay With the C&IS asset management fees the sequential trend was positive You had lower AUM You cited the equity markets there The revenue yield on AUM jumped considerably Was that explained more by the low fees on the sizable index mandate you called out or did the average versus period end levels factor in there,6,56,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.017857142857142856,0.0,1.467600869,14.46,28933.59654,11,0.395835992,2.04537,2015-Oct-26,EQR
And maybe to circle back in your comment about portfolio sales versus individual asset sales I think in the case of another one of your peers who recently structured a transaction to sell itself I think people were initially a little disappointed that pricing was n't as robust as they had hoped Is that maybe an indicator maybe of what you are referring to is that the market is a little bit stronger for single asset sales than there are portfolio sales And that 's why you feel you have more success going that route,3,95,0,0.0,0.031578947368421054,0.031578947368421054,0.021052631578947368,0.010526315789473684,1.981873596,14.46,16114.49808,10,0.159843409,4.75592,2015-Oct-26,EW
As you bring those proceeds back up to Williams Companies what is the preference in terms of what you want to do with that excess cash,1,26,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.4464822919999998,15.29,9343.0983,11,0.341936618,0.04403,2015-Oct-27,UDR
Okay Maybe just {CARDINAL} quick follow up Looking at the loan side of the balance sheet obviously you 've come down a little bit I guess have a little bit of runoff Can you talk little bit about the demand side of the equation my sense is you guys would like to find some loans you could put out and proper spreads and whatnot But are you seeing just kind of most of your corporate clients just really just not even there being anything on the demand side or seeing any change in that like a little bit of a pick up in activity,5,104,0,0.0,0.019230769230769232,0.019230769230769232,0.0,0.0,1.019925867,15.29,24055.1775,12,0.311021717,1.78023,2015-Oct-27,WM
Great Most of my EYLEA questions have been asked But I just wanted to see can you give us any idea about what the indications your new drugs that you put into the clinic are going after now that the {CARDINAL} drug fell out of the clinic and can we learn anything about what that was and what your decision process was to take that out of the clinic,3,69,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.014492753623188406,0.014492753623188406,1.019925867,15.29,24055.1775,12,0.311021717,1.78023,2015-Oct-27,WM
John you said you expect the level of nonperformers and net charge offs to go back to a normal level What do you consider a normal level to be,2,29,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.70845229,15.29,6916.13505,11,0.28359174,2.29691,2015-Oct-27,CNC
Can I just ask you {CARDINAL} strategic question on the Global Group can you comment on where you 're thinking that 's going over like {DATE},1,26,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.038461538461538464,2.70845229,15.29,6916.13505,11,0.28359174,2.29691,2015-Oct-27,CNC
Then I do have a serious question Looking at obviously {DATE} Best Buy I think led the way in a less intense promotional environment or a more favorable promotional environment What do you see so far in {DATE} in the context of the overall holiday shopping trend which looks like it started well on Black Friday but has decelerated since and how are you thinking about the promotional strategy through {DATE} given your current inventory position,3,76,0,0.013157894736842105,0.0,0.0,0.02631578947368421,0.02631578947368421,1.348591448,15.29,21194.00555,8,0.856515921,0.04398,2015-Oct-27,EIX
You talked a little bit about prime mortgage and that it is definitely getting worse But I look at a {CARDINAL} basis point charge off ratio on and say wow that is pretty bad From that as a base how much worse do you envision it getting or could it get,3,51,0,0.0196078431372549,0.0196078431372549,0.0196078431372549,0.0,0.058823529411764705,1.348591448,15.29,21194.00555,8,0.856515921,0.04398,2015-Oct-27,EIX

So the final one for me is on the CapEx slow down where you 've guided that you identified {MONEY} already and I think you said another {MONEY} of things that you could cut Can you talk a bit about the type of CapEx that you 'd be cutting first and what you might be bringing on if prices turn out to be higher,2,64,0,0.0,0.03125,0.03125,0.0,0.03125,2.118435061,15.29,642724.1577,6,0.233070865,1.61845,2015-Oct-27,AAPL

Vikas when you look at the growth rate that you talked about in Europe {DATE} I do n't know if you can be specific but I wanted to know how much you think was volume versus an FX or price headwind Maybe this begs the bigger question is do you think the acceleration here in Europe could be potentially as high as the US or even other regions driven by aHUS,3,71,0,0.0,0.028169014084507043,0.028169014084507043,0.0,0.014084507042253521,1.468685894,15.43,5417.60344,11,1.164564583,1.58951,2015-Oct-28,AIZ
Got it thanks And my follow up in terms of the geographic color you called out Europe was up {PERCENT} in When you 're thinking about {DATE} and {PERCENT} core growth globally what main assumption is there Is it in Europe and the US and a bit more in rest of world Or how quickly do you think that Europe number normalizes,5,62,0,0.0,0.0,0.016129032258064516,0.0,0.0,1.468685894,15.43,5417.60344,11,1.164564583,1.58951,2015-Oct-28,AIZ
Okay You talked about being at the lower end of the glidepath and a bit positioning yourselves to take advantage of moves But we 've seen some moves particularly in the {DATE} pricing in {DATE} and to an extent in {DATE} Can you talk at all about what you 've been hedging Are you kind of locking in any of that seasonality or just generally trying to stay as open as you can given the increased volatility we 've seen in the market,5,83,0,0.0,0.0,0.012048192771084338,0.012048192771084338,0.012048192771084338,1.468685894,15.43,5417.60344,11,1.164564583,1.58951,2015-Oct-28,AIZ

Hey guys Just on the topic of loan growth yours remains pretty good versus peers and I guess I 'm looking at the year over year and thinking about ex some of the sales you had running maybe {PERCENT} Some of your peers have talked about pulling back a bit just as pricing has compressed and some areas like leverage lending may not be as appealing as it was before So just your thoughts on the competitive landscape and do you think you can continue to outgrow the overall industry going forward,5,92,0,0.0,0.021739130434782608,0.021739130434782608,0.010869565217391304,0.0,2.633396699,14.33,26722.06488,4,0.516148806,1.14308,2015-Oct-29,MPC
I 'd like to spend just a bit more time on China Maybe a couple there One Marc when you see the recovery in China where do you think it shows up what segments of the end market And as you think about how the business there grows in {DATE} assuming that budgets start flowing again later in {DATE} could we see a period of accelerated growth with easy comps or do we remain in a somewhat slower growth environment albeit potentially better than what we 've seen in {DATE},5,90,0,0.0,0.03333333333333333,0.044444444444444446,0.022222222222222223,0.011111111111111112,1.357482595,14.33,22390.3974,8,0.753897404,0.55078,2015-Oct-29,PPL
Thank you very much My question is on really your outlook for a step up in affiliate revenue growth In {DATE} you 've completed or you are in the process of completing most of your renewals I guess what assumptions do you have in there in terms of sub declines or just sub outlooks in general And have you seen an acceleration in supply I guess since you initially gave that guidance a little while ago,5,76,0,0.0,0.0,0.013157894736842105,0.0,0.02631578947368421,1.741721815,14.33,8419.22253,11,0.980708892,0.46588,2015-Oct-29,UNM

Just following up on John 's question in Europe with some of the macro concerns in Europe is it possible that we can see similar type of market share gains that we have seen in the U.S. from Nike and are you seeing that at all so far,1,48,0,0.0,0.020833333333333332,0.020833333333333332,0.020833333333333332,0.041666666666666664,1.2494014,14.33,18279.88444,8,0.8885406109999999,1.83279,2015-Oct-29,XEL
It looked like your {DATE} margin was better than your guidance despite the new fulfillment centers whereas for {DATE} you 're guiding for margins to be flat to down {DATE} Is that a delta gain for {DATE} primarily because you anticipate cutting prices to sustain sales growth or is there anything else that is going into the margin evolution,2,59,0,0.0,0.0,0.01694915254237288,0.05084745762711865,0.0,1.2494014,14.33,18279.88444,8,0.8885406109999999,1.83279,2015-Oct-29,XEL

Lastly if I could other banks that seem at a high level to have somewhat similar levels of risk in the securities book are taking pretty big OTTI charges {DATE} including this one When you look out over the rest of {DATE} and kind of embedded within your guidance is there any OTTI assumption included in the guidance and as we think about just reported earnings rather than operating earnings should we expect any meaningful OTTIs as we look out through the rest of {DATE},2,85,0,0.0,0.023529411764705882,0.047058823529411764,0.0,0.0,1.651103428,14.33,6602.933620000002,3,0.329243082,1.00696,2015-Oct-29,XYL

So maybe talk a bit about the challenges in dealing with the vast turnaround times in terms of the technology evolution year in the sense that you 're coming to the customer base consistently with upgrades new products much better cost benefit for them but it 's happening at this incredibly rapid rate And so while that 's great it 's certainly that 's an engineering feat on your part but something from the customer I 'm sure that they 're happy about but certainly need to digest As you continue to churn away here at all the various product lines and continue to expand them what 's been the customer feedback and how have you conditioned the sales force to make sure that this quick turnaround time and this phenomenal R&D pipeline continues to be so well received,3,139,0,0.0,0.007194244604316547,0.007194244604316547,0.03597122302158273,0.014388489208633094,1.678788299,14.33,30555.39166,5,0.296711603,0.5213,2015-Oct-29,APD

High level question for you Tony When you look at US TECFIDERA you obviously have been in the market for {DATE} What types of MS patients are coming on {DATE} and how does that compare to when you launched And then a question for Doug I know it is tough on the LINGO opportunity to say specifically I do n't know if there is a lot of data out there But how does a compromised blood brain barrier correlated to disease severity or progression or relapse frequency things like that that try to correlate that that outcome to clinical benefit or worsening,6,102,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0196078431372549,0.049019607843137254,2.02687947,14.33,14726.49765,11,0.508003462,0.50935,2015-Oct-29,IVZ

Could you talk a little bit more about your expectations for the back {DATE} And I appreciate that at this point you 'd probably want to leave your guidance a little on the conservative side but are you seeing anything specific from competitors either in terms of more aggressive pricing or stepped up promotion or specific new products coming to the market that make you think you 're going to have to respond more aggressively,2,75,0,0.0,0.013333333333333334,0.02666666666666667,0.0,0.0,1.844728181,14.61,342853.7913,4,0.550048026,1.86578,2015-Oct-30,XOM

Hi It looks as if slide {CARDINAL} you 're saying that without a rate increase you 're going to get to your authorized {PERCENT} ROE in {DATE} so is it appropriate to think of the {MONEY} rate increase request as being to cover cost increases and capital that 's going to be invested during {DATE},2,55,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.981125253,14.61,24633.65862,8,1.117443104,1.64789,2015-Oct-30,EXC
Hi Good {TIME} I wanted to ask a question about reimbursement I know you said that the interim through {DATE} you do n't have reimbursement secured but could you give us a feel for which countries have done a better job of securing {DATE} reimbursement and which have higher hurdle rates,4,51,0,0.0,0.0196078431372549,0.0196078431372549,0.0392156862745098,0.0196078431372549,1.897830124,14.61,10958.02344,5,0.395295894,0.04007,2015-Oct-30,EMN
Great I appreciate the color there My second question I 'll try to make {CARDINAL} parts out of it since I 'm limited is on synergies The first part is of the {MONEY} run rate for {DATE} how much of that is a function of just simply closing the headquarters of Republic really more the SG&A type savings as opposed to the cost of operations savings The second part of the question is how much are your synergy targets been impacted by the volume weakness that seems to have really intensified since you originally laid out your synergy targets during {DATE},5,101,0,0.0,0.0,0.009900990099009901,0.009900990099009901,0.04950495049504951,1.192247938,15.07,15745.62444,5,0.015921153,4.9691800000000015,2015-Nov-02,CLX

How much does California you said that if in order to get to {PERCENT} levels you need all of California 's gas fired generation to be online and active whether it is running or as a backup But obviously that means that not all of it is being utilized {DATE} So how much is that gap,3,56,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.017857142857142856,3.114715489,15.07,15380.62848,4,0.7423663770000001,0.32319000000000003,2015-Nov-02,NBL
Sure sure and definitely And clearly you guys bought the gold standard there and just an absolutely great asset As you just think about other opportunities there 's other assets for sale right now in the space clearly ManorCare stands out as just having better quality than everyone else but would you be looking at some of those other assets as well,3,62,0,0.04838709677419355,0.0,0.0,0.04838709677419355,0.0,1.520192634,14.15,19492.47477,11,0.24547075,6.87343,2015-Nov-03,VNO
And then Paul my last question just on the compute strength in {DATE} you talked about SSDs being a component of that strength I guess I 'm a little confused Help me understand what your leverage is to the SSD side of the story and do you see that as a trend that persists into {DATE} as well,5,58,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.034482758620689655,0.05172413793103448,2.573213334,14.15,4494.1503600000015,7,0.272442812,1.60716,2015-Nov-03,DISCA
Thanks good {TIME} On all the regulatory activity that you guys have in process and you expect over {DATE} or {DATE} how concerned are you about ROE cuts that could come under {PERCENT} rather given where interest rates are and some other rate case decisions we 're seeing across the US,2,51,0,0.0,0.0196078431372549,0.0196078431372549,0.0196078431372549,0.0196078431372549,1.6708321469999998,14.15,9854.30817,6,0.35786671600000003,0.83304,2015-Nov-03,HRS

Good {TIME} I just had a couple of questions on your slide {CARDINAL} of the deck The light blue box where you show {MONEY} of uplift versus your rate base implied earnings So I think we said before that {MONEY} or {MONEY} of that in {DATE} is from the income tax repair deduction Is it safe to assume that the rest so {MONEY} to {MONEY} is ongoing That the O&M savings and energy efficiency should roughly offset the EIX Parent expenses,6,81,0,0.0,0.0,0.024691358024691357,0.024691358024691357,0.012345679012345678,1.42030396,14.54,12645.38657,9,0.268120197,2.9308400000000003,2015-Nov-04,HSIC

Yes we all hope not I do n't want to ask you to specifically about any more about the deal you did with Boeing because you said you wo n't talk about it But {CARDINAL} thing I think we 're struggling for is just abstractly in these deals everybody says it 's a win win for everybody but the presumption is that somebody has to give a little more than the other Can you just talk from an abstract perspective of how the horse trading works on these things,4,89,0,0.0,0.0,0.011235955056179775,0.02247191011235955,0.0,5.454912898,14.54,5063.44287,4,1.3886055659999998,1.85514,2015-Nov-04,CHK
